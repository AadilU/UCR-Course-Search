[{"name": "Bannockburn", "reviews": ["THIS IS GOING TO BE LONG : DONT GO HERE !!!!Honestly even if this was the cheapest rent in the area, which it definitely is not, it still wouldn't be worth it.NOTHING WORKS, the stove, the oven, the air conditioning and heat, the heat in the shower , so prepare to take cold showers, and if you're 5'6 or above your head will be above the shower head and if you're not skinny you probably won't fit in the shower . And even if you need something fixed, which you will ,maintenance won't do a single thing. Oh and if you do need maintenance make sure you're up at 8am because if you sleep nude like myself and don't hear the door they will just come in. No privacy whatsoever . Prepare to do the longest deep cleaning in your life when you move in because it's maybe 20+ years of leftover grime, dirt and belongings because no one checks anything. When I moved in the previous resident still had much of their things still there. And if all that wasn't enough be prepared to buy your own internet since they don't clearly state that anywhere and trying to get that done right before the quarter begins is a real hassle. The noise is off the charts from hearing the freeway and the walls being so thin you can hear every conversation and footsteps. Also you're charged an extra month because you move in near the end of the month a few days before the end and they charge you for it.", "Although there is an asbestos warning clearly outlined in the Housing Contract and the Handbook, it will not affect you severely by increasing your odds of getting cancer from it. As long as the walls aren't punctured and the ceiling isn't vacuumed, the material won't be disturbed and get into the air. Asbestos is within the drywall of the walls, so as long as it isn't cut into (ie: thumb tacks, nails...), the chances are pretty low. Plus, we are always in contact with other harmful cancer-increasing factors (second-hand smoke!!), so I wouldn't downplay the price of Bannockburn.Oh and for those reviews criticizing how old the building is, well, you get what you paid for considering the price.Just some food for thought! I gladly signed my contract for Bannockburn over the other apartments.", "Whenever anyone asks where I am currently living, I joke and say \"in a cardboard box\" and sadly it isn't far off from the truth. The apartment complex tends to flood like crazy in random areas. Also, everything is very flamable so there is very little freedom when it comes to any sort of open flames. The rooms are not very well lit and there is only one accessible window in the bedroom. The bedrooms are somewhat roomy and comes with a built-in closet and some book selves which is really nice. The sink is outside of the bathroom and the light switch for the bathroom is also outside. This can be quite inconvenient at first but once you get used to it, its not so bad. The absolute worst part of living here is the bathrooms. There is zero ventilation of any kind and is very prone to growing mold. Gross...However, it is very cheap and essentially you get what you pay for; a cheap, unfurnished apt room with a kitchen.", "So the building is older than me, you, our parents, their grandparents.....They may be older than the moon.  Also, the dirtiest hairy dingleberry asscrack of an apartment I've ever seen.  And I lived there.  I wouldn't recommend getting a furnished one.....I saw those and they were worse.  Try to get new carpet put in.  That makes a WORLD of difference.  But with that student budget, this is the place ;-)  Get on the waiting list early.Before you sign the lease, you have to sign the asbestos notice.  Fortunately(?) for me, they \"forgot\" to give that to me upfront.  I received it 6 months into my lease.But can I complain?  Sure it had the air (literally) of an old needing to be retired building.  Sure the air vents had to be changed and cleaned frequently because there was so much dust you couldn't keep up with it.  And of course, you couldn't clean the crap that spewed out of the airvents onto the lovely stuccoed ceiling/wall because you might release asbestos into the air....but it made you get creative!- 1 star because the management office was not the most efficient or courteous.  Plus, as campus apartments, we actually had resident advisors.....I thought that was only for dorms?  Talk about party busters!!! lol Hey, we tried to invite them to join, but they'd just call the cops (and the poor RAs would follow us as we moved each busted party from one apartment to another lol) Ah, well, it also worked to my advantage.  They messed up and didn't notice that they were only charging me half the rent for half my time there! Let's change this to +1star ;-)- 1 star because the security was CREEPY (wtf?!  Why am I getting stalked by the SECURITY?!  and why is SECURITY following me to see where I live only to knock on my door 30 minutes later -- did I mention it was around 1am when I ran to my friend's apartment to give her something -- why did he come back? to give me his phone number -- YOU\"RE the SECURITY, man! at WORK, not a social venue! --- the second time he straight blocked me from going up the steps to my apartment and I had to get rude.....then the next time.....shall I continue??)- 1 star because, though some of the maintenance were fantastic and efficient...and even courteous and super friendly.....ONE guy jacked my  two playboy editions with China on the cover -- Can you blame him??+ 1 star for cheapass rent (even without the forgetful discount), all utilities included, and for giving me TWO central air units in my apartment -- one for the loft and living room, one for the downstairs room+ 1 star for being upstairs from Getaway and across the street from school", "I like to consider this place as 3rd class on the titanic ship. I remember once I had to jump to get to the apartment because the side walk was flooded. The inside feels cramped and old, especially the furniture and appliances.", "There should be only two reasons why you would ever want to live in Bannockburn. 1. It is the closet apartment complex toward the UC Riverside Campus. In my year of living in Bannockburn, I remember my friends complain that they had to walk or bike all the way from Palms, UV, Grand Marc to get to class. I can leave my apartment 5 minutes before class and be on time, for everyone else its a 15-25 minute walk and in the Riverside Heat or Rain and with no trolly anymore (anyone who enter UCR after 2011 has no idea what that is) it can be hell2. It is pretty damn cheap. For $500, you get your own room. Yes you have to share a bathroom but for that price, I didn't mind. FInd a room mate and your price is half that at $250. All utilities minus internet and parking was included. I had a lot of complaints with Bannockburn but for having my own room for $500 and being so close to campus, I didn't complain even if it was for a year.- There is asbestos in the building. I never received any notice about the asbestos so hopefully I won't get mesothelioma when I am 50. - The carpets has not been changed since the 1980's. I did my best to keep them clean but they look old, had a smell and I was afraid I was going to get some 1890's industrial age disease just by walking barefoot. - Make sure to bring your own shower curtain as the one provided had more mold and mildew than a petri dish in a Chemistry Lab. The bathroom is tiny and if you are lucky, you might get shower pressure or warm water, but you can't have both. You can either have high shower pressure and either a Cold/Really Hot setting or low shower pressure/warm water- Being that this is College, ladies and gents are eventually going to take a friend back to there apartment for the night and let me tell you, it is not bachelor pad. It really feels embarrassing having company over in how rundown the place is. Looking at Bannockburn on the outside, the paint is chipping and it has lost its identity, it looks like a Swiss Lodge in the middle of the Inland Empire. Do your best to make your apartment appealing but don't expect any big parties. - Walking at night at Bannockburn is pretty safe, heard some stuff happening hear and there and it is sure not like Ghetto Ass Grand Marc with people getting stabbed and shot at 2am in the morning on a school night.- Things are always breaking down. My fridge broke down, garage disposable broke down, the air conditioning has two modes, off or San Francisco Cold. Make sure to bring your own Microwave.- The kitchen is really small and outdated and very easy to set off the fire alarm. It is impossible to walk into your room if the oven is open.- The doors don't fit the door hinges meaning if you are making loud noises in the middle of the night, everyone can hear. - Being campus housing, they have RA's. They are only useful to let you if lock yourself out or to get a package for you after-hours, other than that, I have no idea what they do but get free housing a $100 check every month for doing nothing. Waste of Money- Nothing is furnished, it is BYOF. If you are lucky, you might get a room with new updated lighting, some rooms have the old school lights that are contented by a chain from a socket on the wall. Looks like the person who lived here before me was in a S&M movie. All in all, if you want a cheap place close to campus, and you don't plan getting laid in your apartment, Bannockburn might be a good fit for you.", "Lived here my second year cus my parents thought everywhere else ( including this place) was too expensive. Shared a room, roommate was cool so it wasnt too bad. Overall apartment is okay sized however VERY old. Close to school and gym though, wake up 10 mins before class lol.", "I actually didn't think Bannockburn was too bad until I moved into a nicer apartment elsewhere. There was a ridiculous amount of creepy crawly things- like a scorpion (really), rollie pollies, too many spiders, and carpenter ants which invaded my EMPTY apartment while I was gone for summer, despite leaving no food or water in my apartment. There is little to no natural light depending on where your apartment is. Also I had to harass administration to put up a fence around the property, which they said couldn't be done because of environmentalists. Ironically enough, a month before I moved out they put up a fence. The floors really squeak. And don't worry about the asbestos... It won't impact your health until you're 50! My biggest complaint is about administration. John-Paul Wolf is the biggest %#&$! I've ever met. He is a graduate student, and thinks he's the best thing on earth. He likes to throw his cigarette butts on the ground too. You stay classy, JPW.Oh, and if you're bullied by your neighbors for complaining about your neighbors' bad habits (like smoking outside your window), then expect administration (specifically Audrey Pusey) to do nothing about being subsequently harassed. She liked to say that because she didn't know who the girls were, nothing could be done. I knew where one lived, I knew their descriptions, their license plate numbers, etc. but she refused to investigate without concrete evidence of bullying--I guess she wanted me to get my ass beat to prove I was being harassed??? Audrey Pusey didn't do crap until I CCed the dean of students and said I was going to fight the two students... And this is coming from a doctoral student with a full fellowship to UCR. Of course, once Audrey called these girls into her office they admitted to intimating and harassing me on a daily basis... And this went on for probably over a year. Looking back, I probably could have sued the university for negligence and for emotional stress and anxiety  which was university documented by the counseling center. You'll be tempted to live in bannockburn because it's the cheapest campus housing, but don't do it! If you must live there, make sure to carry some sort of weapon--really. There was an attempted rape during the day at bannockburn. The person that was attacked was staff so the incident got a lot of attention. I usually carried pepper spray, a golf club, or a knife--yes really. After the staff member was attacked during the day then i started carrying pepper spray during the day. I lived in the back by the woods before there was a gate so it was scary and dark."]}, {"name": "Falkirk", "reviews": ["DO NOT LIVE IN THESE APARTMENTS.

It's not worth the amount of money you pay.", "I have lived here for about 6 months now and I HIGHLY discourage you from living here. These are the cheapest campus apartments that UCR offers so that was my incentive for living here. But because it is so cheap, the quality is reduced to the bare minimum. If you are looking for the cheapest possible place to live and don't care about the quality, then this could be the place for you. Falkirk Apartments are the most unsafe apartments to live on campus and there is nothing that can be done by the school or UCPD about it. (I go over my experiences below.). Therefore, this is both a racist and classist practice at UCR where low-income students, as well as people of color, are subject to poor and unsafe living conditions, whereas other safer apartments cost so much more. The student's safety should be a priority, so why are the safety and well-being of students of lower income compromised?I'll begin with the minor problems I have experienced. 1. During the hot seasons, ants will be everywhere, especially if you live on the first floor. If you leave any food out overnight, you will wake up to dozens of ants. They are also in the sinks going towards the water to escape the heat, so make sure to buy bug spray. 2. There are no windows in the bathroom. The sink is separated and is part of the bedroom but the shower and toilet are in one tiny and cramped room. 3. This depends on which room you get assigned, but my room has a glass screen door instead of a window. I can never have my blinds open for sunlight because everybody outside can see everything inside. Not to mention how it is highly unsafe and can easily be broken into. If one blind is positioned slightly inwards or to the side, everything inside can be visible.4. You will need to put in a work order for almost everything when you move in. Almost everything is broken like my screen door, shower head, and dishwasher.5. Online it states that Falkirk provides you with internet, which isn't true. You will need to get your own. 6. The only lights are the bathroom and kitchen lights so you will have to buy your own lamps for there to be light in the living room and bedroom.7. Everything was stained or dirty when I moved in like the sink, carpets, walls, and bathroom tiles. Here are the major problems I have experienced at Falkirk and they both have to do with the lack of gates separating it from the public as well as the lack of cameras.1. My tire was stolen off of my car overnight, just a few feet away from where I was sleeping. Someone drove inside with ease, took their time and stole my tire. They rested that side of my car on a brick, which dented the door and the side. It was over $1000 in damage. I called UCPD and filed a police report, where they said there was basically nothing they could do because Falkirk DOESN'T HAVE ANY CAMERAS. I called Housing Services who told me to take pictures of my car and email them a full report of what had happened. They made it seem as if there was some type of action they would take, but they didn't. I had never heard back from them. Not a call or an email. Nothing. I pay $630 to park my car for parts of it to be robbed and there is nothing that can be done about it.2. There was a random, blacked out drunk man who walked into Falkirk with ease, since there are no gates, and tried to get into my apartment while I was home alone. He stayed outside of my door moaning, yelling and banging on my door trying to wiggle the knob to get in. I had never felt more scared and unsafe in my life. I called UCPD who thankfully arrived quickly and arrested him. But again, there was nothing else they could do. 3. I went out to take out the trash while it was dark out and I saw again, a random man, sitting down next to the dumpster mumbling to himself and staring at the wall. I immediately ran inside. He was also later taken away by the police. The minor problems regarding the quality of Falkirk Apartments should come second after the major problems regarding our safety. I don't care if they never fix any of the minor problems, as long as there are GATES put in with a code that only the students have and SECURITY CAMERAS.This is the most important issue that should be addressed here. I should not walk around my CAMPUS apartment with fear. The safety of the students should come first.", "I liked living here. I lived here with my roommate for three years (2012-2015) and the only problem we had was when the pipes burst underneath our apartment and so then Campus Housing accommodated our stay to the Glenn Moore Apartments which was pretty cool.The building that I was located in was the G building and I had clear access/view to the laundromat so I never had any experience with weirdos stealing my clothes (thank goodness). My room was a single and decided to share it out with someone else, but there are apartments that have two rooms (I think). Also when I moved in they had installed new carpets. Pros:+there is a pool with a jacuzzi area +the pool area also provided little events by the Falkirk Housing staff to meet the other residents and occasionally gave pizza (which was pretty nice when you dont want to cook)+ample space (in the single) for both the living room and bedroom. +two sinks+toilet and shower/tub are in a small room in itself so you still have access to the sink/mirror+pretty quiet against the other units. I  never saw/heard any of the other residents when I lived there so good quiet hours for studying/sleeping +good walking distance to the Rec Center/campus+the unit originally had an old air conditioning system which had to be replaced with a newer one and kept the place pretty cool +if you decide to renew your lease for the next year you got the summer rent free but had to pay for the utilites+your utilites are included but will charge you if you go over the limit+basic cable+housing management will come in the late hours if you have a serious housing issue (like when the water pipes burst) +the single had two closetsCons-you need to set up your own internet (I think Glen Moore comes with internet access)-restroom is kind of cramped-i had the bottom floor and therefore had lots of crickets visit me-the unit I had had an old fridge and an old electric stove that took ages to cook stuff and left a nasty irony smell-not furnished besides the fridge and stove so buy your own furniture-laundromat washing machines feel like they don't really clean your clothes-because you have to cook for yourself, your access to super markets is kind of far (both Stater Bros and Food 4 Less)-Canyon Crest is kind of sketchy in itself that it seems like there is always a burglary/attack happening every week. Other than that I had a good experience here. Wish I could reside here once more.", "This is my honest review of the Falkirk Apartments to give you an idea of what it is really like to live here.Pros:-if you get your own room w/o splitting or sharing w/ another, then they are spacious and more than sufficient for one person -the shower/wash area work really well-the kitchen area has lots of cabinets and counter space to store your bits and goodies-the living room and dining room areas have ample space -housing staff typically respond in a reasonable and timely manner (there are exceptions on occasions when they take more than 2 days to respond in person)-very convenient walking distance to the Rec Center and campus-rooms are not 100% soundproof but do a decent job cutting out outside noise (helpful during midterm and final seasons or when you want to sleep quietly)-plenty of hallway storage space (cabinets and slide out closets)Cons:-air conditioning units have a minor sensor glitch during hot seasons-master bedroom (one with personal balcony) tends to heat up quickly during hot seasons and stay really cold during cold seasons (modest insulation issues)-shower heads have a weak stream while showering-personal Internet plans are not included in the monthly rent paymentsOverall, if you are a student transitioning out of the dorms these apartments are a welcome change to the expanded space you will have to yourself and flexibility of how much you can personalize the shared and private spaces to your own liking. Also, the extremely close walking distance to campus are hard to beat at a modest monthly price.", "I moved here as a transfer student in 2017 and shared a room. Yes the rent is cheap and it is very close to campus, but in my opinion it was not worth it at all. The outside and inside of the apartments are dirty and outdated. I had several issues with roaches while living here. I was told that the bugs were in the pipes so there was really nothing they could do about it. The room had windows and a patio that could not be open so I was unable to get fresh air. There was an incident where a bee was stuck in my room and because the windows could not open, it was hell getting rid of it. Maintenance was great and always quickly responded to requests, but honestly this place needs to be torn down. I dreaded coming home to this place everyday. Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to live.", "Ive lived in my apartment for 2 academic quarters now and i have to say its a steaming pile of bullshit. The day i moved in; the stove, AC, cable wiring, sink, and tub were all broken, after i had all of those fixed more things continued to break. Almost everything in this apartment is either broken or close to broken, even the front door doesn't open/close without a hard shove. That's not even the worst part, recently the school decided to permanently shut all sliding glass doors leading to 2nd story balconies. Because they chose to seal the GLASS door and not the already installed SCREEN door we can no longer use it to cool off the apartment on hot days (which happen a lot in riverside). Some second story rooms do not have windows but instead private balconies, Not only does this prevent fresh air flow, but also prevents a safe exit in the event of a fire. Do yourself a favor and do not live here."]}, {"name": "Glen Mor", "reviews": ["This is probably the freshet housing option on campus aside from East Lothian. All of the furniture and buildings are pretty new, and the accommodations and spaces are amazing. These are apartment style so each of your roommates gets a single room and there is a common space for every 4 single rooms. The apartment spaces come furnished with a few pieces of furniture, but you will need to provide things like a television or anything related to media. Glen Mor also requires that you have a meal plan, but that is more flexible than the first year plan. You can get a meal plan that exclusively has $400 dining dollars, or you can get another balance of dining dollars and meal swipes. Glen Mor is also the most expensive of all of the on campus apartments - in total it comes at a similar price to living in a residence hall. However, the accommodations provided compensate for that price difference, as well as the proximity to campus.", "If you prefer to live in a college dorm with no smoking, skip UC Riverside.UC Riverside is a smoke free campus - that's no smoking on campus and in the dorms. But this law is not enforced at all. In fact, it's a joke!Turns out that if you don't want your roommate to smoke in a \"smoke free\" dorm - YOU have to move to another place. UCR responds by offering the smoker a program to quit smoking and then looks the other way.All the dorms are smoke free.Yet this week, 3 roommates are moving out of their smoke free Glen Mor apartment because the housing admin is unable to move a fourth roommate who smokes (pot and cigarettes), and drinks in the apartment. Even after the smoker is asked to comply they continue to smoke. And then cover it up with lemon air freshener.You'd think this would be a simple issue: break the contract rules of the dorm (and the campus), get a warning and if you don't comply after complaints are filed you are moved from the dorm. Not true.", "I lived here my sophomore year at UCR (2009-2010) and I loved it. I was in a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom suite and it was awesome. Glen Mor is furnished; the kitchen is spacious w/ a dining table & chairs, roomy cabinets and a large pantry, and there is a nice living room area w/ a large couch, chair, standing lamp, coffee table, entertainment display, and end table w/ lamp. Bedrooms are honestly somewhat small, with furniture identical to that of the Pentland Hills dorm rooms - a single twin XL bed, desk w/ whiteboard & shelf, chair, nightstand w/ double drawers, and closet with cool sliding/folding door. The fact that Glen Mor is furnished saves you a TON of hassle that other students living elsewhere have to do (LOAD up furniture, CARRY furniture, then MOVE everything out come the end of the year) - I feel what you pay extra for at Glen Mor could likely equal what you would pay when buying your own furniture if you lived in an unfurnished apartment. Just save yourself and your family members/friends the physical labor! Besides, the furniture given at Glen Mor is modern and comfortable, so it's a win win.Amenities of living at Glen Mor include:-Weekly cleaning from a cleaning lady. You WILL NOT find this anywhere else, and it's a huge plus for guys who are messy (not saying I am one of them). Note only your bathroom, living room, and kitchen will be cleaned (no, the lady will not do your dishes) and you are responsible for upkeep of your bedroom.-If you have a car and parking permit, there is parking in Lot 21 (shared with Pentland Hills residents, but it's way better than not having a designated lot to park in. No matter how packed, you are guaranteed to find a spot to park in!). If you don't have a car, there's the Highlander Shuttle that stops in front of Glen Mor hourly I think.-Although Glen Mor is supposedly the most expensive apartment option at UCR, it's well worth it. It's relatively new, modern in design, and clean. There are other apartment options (like Bannockburn Village) that are infamously old, dirty, and uncomfortable (majority opinion here, from what I've heard). A Glen Mor 2 is scheduled to be open in Fall 2014.-Scotty's, a convenience store with a sandwich grill, is located right on the floor level-One main study room that consists of full length glass sliding doors. It's invigorating to slide open all walls on a warm spring day to study, feeling the breeze. The sun is blocked by the D Building, so it's nice & shady in the study room! The room is generally empty except for when midterms and finals come around.-A 24 hour computer lab w/ printers. The printers are jammed a lot, but really, it's better than having no printers or no 24hr access (or having to rush to Watkins' print labs). I cannot stress how many times this place will save your life (esp. since every student is given a certain amount of money to use for school printing every year). Whether you need to print out that all nighter essay @ 4am or get a last minute copy of those notes you need to bring to your 8am class, this lab will be a life saver (assuming the printers aren't malfunctioning)! I know from experience! The lab is located behind Scotty's, so it's also of walking distance for Glen Mor residents.-The university recreation center is not too far a walk and Glen Mor residents can also use the Pentland Hills gym (although the equipment is very limited) located under the H Building.-There is a soccer field. Soccer games take place frequently throughout the week, including some games by Pentland residents. Noise is sometimes an issue, though! The field is also good for jogging around (although be careful near Watkins Drive since a lot of crime happens there)-All buildings have elevators and stairwells. Warning that D Building's elevator is VERY slow-Sunrise and sunset are sights to behold at Glen Mor, given it is located nearest to the hills surrounding campus.-I personally liked the full length glass walls near the elevators (I think every building has this) that overlooked the horseshoe & pathways of Glen Mor. Sometimes while waiting for the elevator, you can take a second and just watch life go by.-You use the university's Internet and cable, so no need to PAY EXTRA and deal with the HORRID cable companies to get your stuff set upAnd just a note, the fact that Glen Mor is located ON CAMPUS makes it a lot safer. A quick Yelp search will show LOW ratings for many other off campus apartment options for UCR students. For ex., Bannockburn is infamous for being the front scene of a lot of attempted robberies and rape (and the university police station is just down the street, too). UCPD and campus security routinely drive around Glen Mor too, so that is something to rest assured knowing.Definitely consider Glen Mor in your housing options once the application time comes, or if you are a transfer student. It's expensive, but worth it for all the amenities, convenience, and safety.", "If you're okay with placing yourself or college student in a nasty apartment that is not cleaned between renters, then this is the place for you. We just moved my boyfriend into summer housing as he previously lived in the Glen Mor however this time is completely different. Upon arrival and unpacking there were clothes left behind in his drawers, a broken nail in the desk drawer. Along with miscellaneous trash and tissues in the others. The floors were clearly not mopped or vacuumed and the bathroom and kitchen were not cleaned. There were pee spots all over the toilet seat. Luckily we brought Lysol and a mini vacuum because we cleaned everything before placing his belongings away. For summer housing that is overpriced as it is, they could at they very least clean the apartment before new students move in. Additionally we initially thought we were in the wrong building as previous students names were still taped to the outside of the door. Unacceptable and disgusting. I started taking pictures halfway through cleaning but you get the gist.", "I had the privilege of living here for two years - half of my undergraduate career at UCR. Looking back, it was my favorite place of the four housing complexes I lived in during my time at UCR.The very convenience of Glen Mor being located right on campus with the residence halls, rather than across the street or a couple blocks away like the other campus apartments, makes a HUGE difference. Robberies and other crimes are an all too common occurrence on Canyon Crest and University, and being away from that area gave me a reassuring sense of safety. It's nice to be able to walk to and from the library and Rec Center at night without any worry of being a victim of a crime.Glen Mor opened in the fall of 2007, so it's still a new complex and it is infinitely nicer than many other of the on-campus housing complexes.The bedrooms are small, but I believe they are adequate for a single person in a single bedroom (as is the case for all bedrooms here). The living room and kitchen are very spacious with comfortable enough furniture provided. It's so easy to take the many amenities at Glen Mor for granted. There is a 24-hour computer lab which is a godsend if you need to print out a paper and don't have your own (working) printer. Scotty's, open until 2am on weeknights, is also a a godsend for those late-night munchies! (It also saves you a trip to 7-11). There is also a study room and a laundry room.oh yeah, a cleaning lady comes once a week!Most students who live here are second-years with a sizable number of third-years. I even knew fourth-years who lived here! It does cost a pretty penny to live here but I think it's very much worth it, and I have no complaints about living here.", "I lived here its inaugural year and had a great experience living here! The place was clean and even though they were still putting in people's furniture, we had all of ours. It is a little bit pricey, but your accommodations come with a meal plan that has dining dollars you can use at the convenience store downstairs - Scotty's. I used to work there and it was definitely convenient to get between home and work.The room was a 4br, 2 bath place. Stove, full fridge, dish washer, garbage disposal, large sink, many cabinets, a dining table, and chairs. Bathrooms were separate sink area from the toilet and shower. Rooms had an extra long twin bed, desk, chair, drawers, and decent size closet. Living room had a sofa, chair, table, lamps, and tv stand.Laundry room, computer lab, convenience store, and admin offices on site.

It's about a 15 minute walk from campus and there's also a bus stop right across the street. The whole apartment itself is spacious; however there is little closet space if you share a room. In a double, you get half a closet and 4 drawers, which are underneath the bed. They recently installed wifi so that's an upgrade, but the wifi is really inconsistent. There are multiple days jn a month where wifi is down, which sucks because then you can't do homework. I like the events the RA plans at Stonehaven. They usually give free stuff and it's sort of educational.There are so many water shutoffs. You can't flush the toilet, shower, or use the sink. There's no adjustment for the water temperature when you're showering. The knob only turns in one direction. My biggest complaint is the bipolarness of the water temperature. On some days, it's really nice and warm. On bad days, it's freezing cold or steaming hot. Those bad days can last for 3-4 days, so imagine showering in extremely hot or cold water for 4 days straight. It gets so bad that I have to walk to the gym to shower and that gets so annoying. The bathroom is probably the dirtiest part. There's a lot of mold and it gets really disgusting. There are also lots of bugs in the apartment. I remember killing 6 small bugs in the kitchen in one day. No matter how much you clean there will always be a slight bug infestation. I really hope Stonehaven does some major renovations with the plumbing system. The maintenance workers are really efficient. One you send a work order in, they fix the problem in a day or two. Stonehaven also increased the rent to $655.", "Review for 2019-2021-Third party owned-Wi-Fi issues-black mold in bathrooms; maintenance just paints over it-ANTS AND BUGS-MAINTENANCE MEN WALK INTO UNITS WITH 0 NOTICE (huge concern for me happened to me THREE times while living here ALONE)-manager burst into my apartment too one of the times very unprofessional and rude without notice-UCPD and housing will not help you -crackheads knocked on my door UPSTAIRS-gardener stole my boyfriends wallet-Covid-19 policies were ridiculous -pro tip: if you don't want any particular furniture request or not to be there upon move in (I brought my bed doing this)-you're not getting your deposit back lol-really old appliances; if you enjoy cooking it sucks-ugly classroom carpet-fire alarm sensitive esp when cooking and generally really irritating -parking has plenty but it's expensive and doesn't offer a payment plan & UCR is quick to ticket you when it expires!-love to tell you last min if you go over electricity allowance and then now you're paying large sums grown over time-fridge is small, 1 occupancy is fine, 2 occupancy is fine, but 4 occupancy I have no idea how they'd share the kitchen spaceOverall I'd never live here again. This experience pushed me to move off campus. It was the most child treated adult complex ever with stupid policies.ALSO, when I lived here the manager had a dog and we couldn't have pets LOL. My boyfriend picked me up with his puppy and she fr had the dog in her hand and told him he couldn't bring his into the complex period.

It's honestly the worst apartment among ucr with highest price. What can I say, I mean I have been deal with the damage for weeks. It's a bad thing when you have class, because you couldn't always concentrate in your class. Unless you buy your own internet.You could be always check your apartment and do maintenance. But the good thing is maintenance staff are professional.Living here is make your life hard.", "Our wonderful maintenance man Joey has been GREAT in assisting any need fixed here in our apartment. He has come within minutes of putting in our request and exceeded me & my roommates  expectations. Highly recommend him! Stonehaven apts is a great place to live & I enjoy staying here. Great maintenance makes it all the better. Whether it's the garbage disposal, sink, toilet, or AC he is ON IT. 10/10 recommend.", "Living at Stonehaven is fantastic! Very quiet and maintenance is always punctual and helpful. The maintenance supervisor Joey and tech Garrett worked on getting me hot water in my shower and fixing my dishwasher in under an hour!!  Thank you for all your help and for working in such a timely manner:)", "1/16/17 NEW EDIT:When I came back to my apartment to get the last of my things during the last week of June, SOMEONE BROKE INTO MY APARTMENT???? WHAT?? Hell no. Regardless if it's gated or not, there's so many robberies and break-ins. I'm glad I wasn't there when they broke in. They completely destroyed the door handle. EVEN WORSE, I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS BREAK-IN FROM MY ROOMMATE. ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE FROM STAFF / HOUSING. What kind of staff is this when they don't report the break-ins to the people living in the area? And even after cleaning up the space, they took half of the security deposit for \"cleaning purposes\". Okay?? I still had flying cockroaches in the apartment so good luck to whoever lives in there next year. D240. Previous Review: This place is horrible. Stay away if you can. BUG PROBLEM: My housemates and I dealt with a roach problem for more than half the year and they are still in the apartment. They constantly multiplying and the management has done nothing significant in getting rid of them. I'm pretty sure when I moved out, there were even more. Flying ones too. Bathroom: will always mold. For being the newest apartment complex, shouldn't you at least have a bathroom fan? Even the older apartments have them. Kitchen: I have no idea who designed this kitchen but it is tiny and squishy. Someone's always burning something so the fire alarms go off a lot at any time of the day. Not worth your time or money.", "Living here is a terrible experience, the living condition is the same as any other college dorm but you're paying much more. My main complaint is with the main office especially Thuy Pham. She is only nice to you before you move in but after she becomes very rude. My packages are ALWAYS delayed, the tracking app said it delivered to the office in the morning yet it took them until CLOSING TIME to email me to pick up. And when I went to pick up they weren't available even though I went once when my package came and they told me they were \"busy\" with bunch of packages yet they do not do any work. Save yourself the trouble and time and brainpower instead of trying to communicate with these people.", "I do NOT recommend staying here, even if it's convenient.  They claim that they're associated with UCR, but when you ask them anything about UCR, they never have a clear answer, and always state that they're \"third party\".  My main problem is with the RSO staff, mainly Thuy Pham.  She is very condescending and rude, and just a plain b****.  She is a liar, and is only nice before you sign a contract.  Afterwards, she goes back to being rude.  Consider your security deposit non-refundable, because Stonehaven will always find something to charge you with.  Avoid this place at all costs.  You'll regret it if you stay here.   -UCR student", "The ratings don't make sense to me!! At first I wasn't too happy with the price of rent since I signed up for a cheaper place, but when I tell people my rent is $620, they think it's a rather good deal so I no longer have complaints regarding rent. Reading through the other reviews I feel like they are just being really high maintenance and nit-picky. I absolutely enjoy my stay here!!!There's so much to say...For one, even though it's the furthest on-campus apartment from school, it's still fairly close! (Get that exercise) but the best part is that the bus stop is literally across the street!! The buses come so often that there's not much waiting involved so when you DO get lazy there will be a bus to take you near school ^^ I take it quite frequently~My apartment is fairly clean too!! It feels nice to look at clean, white walls. I have no problem with the furniture, it has everything you need and the living room is so housemates-friendly seeing how they have 3 tables, so we often all study together in the living room. Fun!It's big enough for 4 people to live, and if you're moving here from the dorms you will have no complaints about the size.Let me address some common issues I've seen in the reviews:1. For bugs I haven't seen much... maybe a few spiders but what place doesn't have spiders?? Never encountered much else. No roaches or mice, no problem :)2. Leaf blower!!! It's true he still comes almost every morning around 9/10 to do his job but it really just takes some getting used to. And it's short... you can listening to music for those 15 mins... it will wake you if you're sleeping but that really isn't much of a problem for people who have class around 9/10... and the worker is extremely nice!!! He's the same guy who fixes stuff when you put in work orders, friendly and reliable! Say hi to him when you can! :D3. Like I said, the furniture is fineee, it's usable and my housemates and I never complain.I really like how they have events for us often too! My friend won a hoodie from raffle and there's often free food :)) COFFEE EVERY MORNING FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT!!But seriously, the best part is the people who work at RSO. They are all so so so friendly and try to fix any problems you have. I can see they are sincere in helping whoever comes up to them. Once I texted them because I was upset they ran out of donuts so quickly, so they next time they had donuts they texted me saying they saved some for me...!! I was so so happy!! They are really great people that will try their best to make your stay a happy one :))I really like Stonehaven!! [but please don't start requesting donuts XD]", "TL;DR: BUG INFESTATION, FREQUENT WATER SHUTOFF, NO SECURITY DEPOSITI could give 0 stars I would. I lived here for two years and while the property is okay, and the maintainence crew is great, there's a few things that made it a collectively awful experience.#1: the water pipe down the street constantly bursts which means there's no water for a day for about once a month. Annoying, but not so bad if you're always in class.#2: for a few weeks I had been finding little wings in my shower and sink and ignored it, until one day I came home and there were HUNDREDS of some sort of flying maggots (terrifying, right?) in my sink. I called the RSO and guess what they said? Suck it up, it's not an emergency, maintenance is gone. I was traumatized so I stayed somewhere else for the weekend (this happened on a Friday) then on Monday they finally cleaned it up and I could go back it. I still found little wings around the bathroom for months after. Not only did they handle it terribly but I found out after some of my own investigation that the bugs had COME OUT OF THE WALLS where they had hatched from eggs (?) and were crawling into the sink to find water and subsequently drown or die from thirst. Really cool.#3: my roommate had to move out early and return her keys so they had the lock changed. I knew it might happen but I wasnt sure when. Sure enough one day I came home from class and MY OWN KEY DIDN'T OPEN THE FRONT DOOR. I WAS LOCKED OUT OF MY OWN APARTMENT. All because maintenance and management didn't think it was necessary to inform the people who still lived in the apartment that they were changing the locks because the keys were lost. I complained to Housing and I got a written letter apologizing for the inconvenience. Still very unprofessional and honestly, a really stupid mistake on their end.#4: Finally, I didn't get my security deposit back. And neither did a single other person I knew who lived there. Shocker.Other than that, I must say that the RA's were AWESOME and handled things really well. But I definitely wouldn't recommend someone to live here under any circumstances. For the same amount of money you could get your own master bedroom with a bathroom in a house and not have to pay for parking. Please make Stonehaven your last choice for on campus living.", "Style: Double occupancyRent: $620 (2017-18), $639 (2018-19)..Not happy about that raise in rent!Distance from UCR: Walkable, you can use a scooter or bike to get to campus faster. First moved in: The apt is pretty spacious on the inside. The bathroom was moldy(specifically the toilet)...yuck! The desk chair....hmm...well it was one of those cafeteria plastic chairs.  I noticed the walls were pretty thin. The kitchen is one of my favorite features of the apartment. It is pretty nice. It has a raised bar design. One thing that really irked me was the fact that there was no wifi and you had to use the Ethernet adapter...a really big pain in the butt.  Outside of the apartment: The lobby is quite nice, it has a hotel feel to it. The lobby is where you will pick up packages, find your mail in the mailboxes, and sometimes there are mini snacks you can grab in the morning.It can get a little dark at night because half of the lights are usually off. So if you want to feel really safe, this is not the place you're looking for.  The pool area is nice. There are restrooms where you can clean off. I recommend it if you want to take a break for work.The office workers are really kind. They try their best to address your issues. There is a resident adviser per 2 buildings (?) I might be wrong. You can also talk to them if you have any problems. After a year of living there: I would say it is not too bad. I don't want to pay for parking in UCR so i opted to live in this aptment. The distance is totally doable. If you take night classes, the escort system can take you here. They did repaint everything before the new school year..not sure if that's an every year thing. Interior-wise, I recommend it if you're a chill-at-home type of person and if you like house chores. This place requires some maintenance because it can get dirty after a while.Would I live here again? Mmm, yes for the time being because it's reasonable close, but if they continue to raise the price...I rather not. You can live somewhere nicer with the amount you pay. But you do save gas and utility fee.", "Stonehavens rent for double occupancy went from $639 to a whopping $670 in a couple months. The complex isn't necessarily horrible but DEFINITELY NOT worth $670 for double room, especially when every other week there would be water shutoffs or wifi problems. Also since it's COVID quarantine, I literally have no money to pay rent and am also back home with my family. But Thuy chooses this time to be a scammer and suck as much money out of me as possible. I literally was in tears when I left her office. I have to pay $2000 to leave the apartment. How would I have known that COVID would turn out this way? Yet she says I should have left earlier if I didn't want to pay this much. So it's either pay $2000 to keep the apartment I don't live in for a quarter or pay $2000 to leave the apartment.", "Okayy let me get started with Stonehaven. Oh was I decieved, in the beginning of the quarter when I first moved in everything was going fine. Whenever we had an issue they would come and fix it fast. But after the year started progressing the place went DOWN HILL. Like let me tell you the manger is very rude to her tenants, she acts nice at first but is very disrespectful in the way she talks. She will side eye and try to talk back to you if she doesn't like what you say. And the apartment, full with bugs, we had termites which they say are \"waterbugs.\" Which I dont buy because if they were water bugs why did they have to call pest control and spray our walls.  Please don't live here they just rip you off of your money and they don't even care about you.", "Our internet was broken because we had no ports in our room. We asked help from res tech and UCR managment, they did not help. But our manger of Stonehaven came out of her way and removed the ports and fixed the cable! Best management, comes to the rescue while we are on hold with UCR res tech management!", "I lived at Stonehaven Apartments for two years.  During the time being, I never encountered any issues with the management or maintenance team.  My repair orders were always taken care of within a reasonable time- one or two days, unless it was something more urgent; in that case, the issue was responded to almost immediately.  The Stonehaven premises are always kept nicely gardened and are safe/quiet.  I did not have a roommate and even then, safety was never an issue.  Although the management crew was very nice and respectful, I chose to live somewhere else this year.  Stonehaven is a bit pricy considering that it is one of UCR's student housing options and it does come fully furnished.  Also, utilities and free internet/cable are included, which is appreciated. P.S. the pool area is so beautiful at Stonehaven! New chairs and cabanas. Cons: parking is expensive. :(", "This review is for Josie from the RSO! She was so helpful in answering all my questions and making sure that everything was cleaned and sanitized when I went to use the laundry room. Josie was very kind and genuine about helping me out! Thank you!", "Stonehaven is honestly one of the worst apartments that UCR has to offer. First off, the bathrooms don't have fans and there's only a tiny window you could open for ventilation. The bathroom also started developing mold due to the LACK OF VENTILATION. Another problem was the shower stalls which was stained and unclean. Another thing that was bad about the management was with the assistant to the manager Thuy Pham. I had an incident where I went to go pick up a package and then she asked me about my rent and then she has the audacity to tell me to not spend my financial aid on useless packages. Honestly, the disrespect I felt when she said that was infuriating because she did not know my financial situation at all and for her to say something so condescending and absurd as a manager just aggravates me. The kitchen space is also really small, which is hard when you live in an apartment with 4 people and everyone has to cook. Homeless people getting into the community is also another complaint. I had one occurrence when I was walking back at night and I saw a homeless guy using the showers near the pool, which startled and nearly scared me to death. Water shutoffs are a normal thing, so just be ready to adjust your schedule accordingly. This is just for my building but some dude was burning something in his kitchen and set off the fire alarm like 3 times which really pissed me off. Everyone had to leave the apartment and literally waste time standing outside. I didn't have any bug problems so thank god for that. THE WIFI HOW COULD I FORGET. Stonehaven has literally garbage wifi and garbage is an understatement. Everyday it was constantly disconnecting and we kept getting emails about \"new\" internet being installed but when it got \"installed\" THERE WAS LITERALLY NO CHANGE. My apartment mates decided to get our own internet. We actually used our OWN money to pay for good internet along with the bullshit rent fees because it was that bad. It was literally intolerable and negatively impacted my studies. Other than that, I feel the distance is not too bad but if you have late classes, the walk back can be sketchy as there's always homeless people wandering about near the crosswalk. The only thing I actually liked about stonehaven was the maintenance guy. He literally just did his job and was professional about it. That is the kind of professionalism I want to see at the RSO. This is not worth your time and you are better off living somewhere else.", "I lived here for three years, and the reviews made it seem like it was going to be a nightmare moving in. While it has been far from perfect, it was definitely NOT as bad as some people make it seem.Pros: close to campus, covered by financial aid, reliable laundry service, responsive RAs and maintenance crew, decent sized room (for one), really sweet front desk staff (the Asian lady at the front is as sweet as can be, she just doesn't put up with anyone's bullshit), complimentary coffee and biscuits in the front office almost every morning, overall very chill and safe environment (no break ins during my 3 years here).Cons: EVERYTHING BREAKS, the furniture is extremely cheap and is in need of an upgrade; the AC vent in the bedrooms is tiny and it can make it pretty stuffy on a hot day, the water in the shower won't heat up in the morning, the bathrooms get black mold very easily so make sure you're not taking long steamy showers, the bathrooms have a pretty bad bug problem (gnats, spiders, etc) but that is just a part of the riverside environment (invest in some of the raid ant traps and spider repellent), Canyon Crest Drive is EXTREMELY loud at night so make sure you get an apartment on the inside of the complex or else you'll be woken up every five minutes by motorcycles, drunk kids on the streets, trains, and car horns; the rent is just too high for the relatively mediocre quality of the apartment.Again, it's far from pefect, but it's what most college kids should expect from their first big boy/girl apartment. Its definitely more independent living than the other campus apartments, since the RAs are non existent until the end of the quarter unless you explicitly call them. I kept a dog here for two years and she was never discovered, so you can expect to not have a babysitter like you had in the dorms.", "The customer service is overwhelming amazing. The employees here show compassion and enthusiasm to every resident. One of the employees, Thuy Pham, is truly the best. She is always welcoming to me and every resident. She loves to have conversations and is always willing to help me when I need it. Living here has been a blast and I'm thankful I chose to live here.", "Don't move in here. They will find a way to squeeze every dollar out of you.... I mean it stay away.", "Pros:-Unlike most reviews make it seem, it is not far from campus. It's a 15 minute walk at most so I don't understand why so many people complain, and the bus stop is literally in front of stonehaven which takes you right to campus. -The apartment themselves are spacious and well maintained. I just moved in this year, but according to other people who have lived here for longer, Stonehaven got new furniture which I think gives the apartment a nice touch. -There is a pool, and a basketball and volleyball court which are nice places to hang out with friends.- THE CLEANING SERVICE LADY IS REALLY REALLY NICE. I believe her name is Jocelyn but don't quote me on that. Every time I go to the RSO she offers me candy or any sweet. She's really helpful, sometimes even more helpful than other people in charge, and just really nice. There was one time when I didn't take enough coins to do my laundry so she gave some without hesitation. So if you decide to live here, make sure you always greet her because she's really cool.Cons- Rent. $655 per person for a two bed apartment is a lot. Plus, the $3-$6 payment fee for every transaction. -The pool has no heater so the water is really cold even when it 90 degrees outside.- They often cut hot water for maintenance.-The WiFi is not the best.", "Don't live here!!!!!. Bathroom's are prone to mold. When i moved in last year my entire unit was disgusting! I grew tired of cleaning after 10 hours. Management also likes to use LOUD LEAF BLOWERS DAILY starting at 7 am monday through saturday. Rain, shine and finals week alike, the leaf blowers will be your new alarm clock. In addittion management will try to keep your deposit when they know the condition of their units. In addition when you call them and try to get the issue resolved Nidia will try to talk over you and hang up in your face, as if you didn't pay you rent just everyone else. And after Thuy will tell you multiple times \"I dont believe she hung up on you.\" The management team are jokers and crooks in my opinion. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT LET THEM TAKE AN ADVANTAGE OF YOU. Dont play yourself. Dont live here ! Go highlanders! Just not here. Please !", "It is what you make it. Older property that needs some love. Staff was very friendly and helped with a few move-in Maintenance issues. Very spacious for one Student. Bedroom is much larger than last year's Dorm Room. I think my daughter will be happy here this year.", "Stonehaven is a great place to live while in college if you have nice roommates to share the experience with. Nice space that you can do a lot with if you choose to make it your own. Thuy Pham in the front office and the maintanence workers have been so helpful in my past two years living in this complex. Its close to school(right next to bus stop and about a 15 minute walk) so its super convenient on those days where class seems like a last priority. If you can be organized the size of your shared space works out. Tool and newly put in cabanas are nice environment to chill and study and when you sign a release you get your summers for free!!!", "I want to warn all ucr students... DONT LIVE HERE!RAs are totally unprofessional, i ask them to deal with a noise complaint, they told me to do it! i call the riverside police and they told me im not suppose to do it, the RA is suppose to.  I had to get the police to call the RA to do their job basically. STORY OF MY LIFE.The ladies who work at the counter are also generally rude, especially the older black woman. There is also little point of buying a parking permit here.If i could just help one person avoid this horrible place, i would be so joyful.", "So its the end of the year, I'll update as a FINAL review for this place.The maintenance guys remain prompt with the work orders I submitted, I don't know why people said they're slow. I filed a work order for a broken toilet handle and a dead light bulb, they fixed it the SAME DAY I placed the work order.Something I forgot to mention about the apartment, the place molds fast as FFFUUU (mainly the restroom). The toilet molds. The bath tub molds. The bathroom CEILING/WALL molds. There were also random amounts of ants, but there were never enough for me to go complain about it. In addition, the fire alarm goes off LIKE CRAZY if your building is full of people who don't know how to cook sh*t. So advice for people who DO or DON'T know how to cook: JUST TURN ON THE FAN ABOVE THE MICROWAVE. Save people their sleep/ears. You're lucky if you live in the smaller buildings like B. OH, the thing that made me and my roomies mad was the fact they will randomly charge you for \"overage of utilities.\" My roomies and I did not have a TV and we were very conservative with the AC/lights/everything else, but they managed to charge us $4.12 EACH. Our neighbors got charged the exact amount who DID have a TV. It really makes you go \"WTF, really?!\" They WILL find ways to charge you.For whoever is considering to live here, PLEASE consider these reviews as WARNINGS. Best of luck to you!", "Yeah, it looks like a really nice apartment complex. A nice looking pool, a gated community, nice looking workers. But NO, do not be mistaken!!!The walls are THIN, you can hear every little detail from your neighbors next door or upstairs/downstairs or even people walking in the halls. It was nice that the place was furnished, but it was not worth the stay. Thuy, the assistant property manager, is really nice, SOMETIMES. But the other lady, I believe Sandra, the REAL property manager is a real BEEP (for lack of a better term).The office is REALLY slow with their mail. I had tracking on many of my packages. It arrived on time, but the office did not give me my \"slip\" or send me an email until days later and would not allow me to pick it up without either.I went into the office looking to replace the battery on the parking lot remote. Apparently, I walked into the black woman Sandra yelling at one of the maintenance guys, who is usually VERY prompt with work orders (usually within a day!), and as soon as I walked in, she gave me an attitude with the impression of \"what do you want?\" She is just plain rude. The RAs shouldn't even be RAs. They write these newsletter with a million typoes and some do not attend to any of the problems addressed (noise complaints, etc.)On another note, my car got broken into, as do many cars in the lot. I ran to the office to report this incident to Thuy. A few days later around renewal time, she had the nerve to ask me if I'm renewing my contract, I politely said no, and she asked why not? And I thought to myself, \"well my CAR got broken into, what do YOU think?\"Also, the rent is EXPENSIVE ($476 per person if you live in a 2 bedroom/2 bath), and then around 450+ for the parking permit. UGH. You can get your own room at some other places for that price!! I got overcharged $2.92 for utilities. For $2.92, they do not accept CASH. I had to waste a check just for that.DO NOT LIVE HERE!! This place is only worth one star, but the maintenance guys are really nice and attend to work orders quickly!", "Is there an option of no star? I absolutely despise this place. The walls are paper thin. I can hear people walk down the hallway at 4AM. I can also hear my neighbor watch Law and Order in his living room. Nothing ever works here. Our apartment came with a broken closet, a dirty toilet, and a clogged kitchen sink. The carpet was extremely dirty; we literally vacuumed dirt and soil from it. But I would have to say the management is THE worst. I've never met anybody who is as consistently rude as the two ladies who work in the front. They're only nice to you in February when the contract renewals are due. Your packages will always take an extra two days to process to you once it's delivered to the office because the rude ladies up front claim that \"they receive over two hundred packages daily and it takes a long time to sort.\" That is their excuse every single time. They ALWAYS mix up our mail; someone else's magazines or letters always end up in our box. This place is complete bull and a waste of money.", "Stonehaven is an on campus apartment run through UCR. The apartment complex itself, I thought was a little small compared to other apartment complexes in the area but the one thing that they do provide is that Stonehaven comes furnished. I shared a bedroom with one roommate and it did seem small at times in order to make room I brought my desk out into the living room in order to make space. They do provide cable with the monthly cost; however, their programming is not in hd which surprised me since the dorms does include HD cable programming. They also have a utility bill that K seemed to go over every month which made no sense to me. The one positive I had about Stonehaven is that their parking lot is gated.", "This place isn't the best but it isn't terrible. Walls are thin but other than that no real complaint except the excess utilities charge. Me and my roommate hanged our light bulbs to energy efficient ones and that helped.", "For the typical UCR student looking for a complex within a few blocks of campus, and as well as furnished, Stonehaven seems like the  best bet.I needed a place to be furnished, but most things did not come cheap especially compared to UV towers, Glen Mor, and Grand Marc.UVt is about 800 a month in a single, glen mor about 900 a month (with dining dollars) and I believe Grand Marc around the same price. None of these complexes allowed double occupation.Stonehaven did and that is why I ultimately chose it. Since I did choose UCR Housing, it was relatively easy to file the necessary contracts compared to the nasty papers I filed at UVT the year prior.- Maintenance Staff is up to par with their job. I ask for a work order and within a day or two it's done, with no problems. - Noise maybe a problem. The walls are pretty thin, but if you have the right residents you should be fine. I do get annoyed of the occasional heels sound on the walkways, but I am a girl so I understand.- Management has always been friendly to me. Every question I have asked, they have answered me respectfully. - The pool is well maintained but not warm.- Security is not an issue.Ultimately, I do not LOOOOVE the place, but for the price I pay and for the service I receive as well as the proximity to campus, I am a happy resident, and I think it's safe to say that most of my apartment mates would agree.But if you have the money, GO GLEN MOR! It's a great place to live at. Just very very pricey.", "Really great environment to live in. It feels safe and the community overall is really friendly. Apartment was in good condition when I moved in and the staff are all really great. Worth the move in.", "Honestly, this place isn't as bad as people say. The only downside about this place is that rent is so expensive ($620 a month w/o utilities).", "First off I regret not reading these Yelp reviews before I signed up to live there. Every month my roommates and I (4 of us) would likely pay about $50-70 in total for electricity(and we didn't use much I was hardly there)! They were really rude and pretend to be your friend at the leasing office. It's unsafe here!!! One of my roommates bike was stolen in the bike storage. And some guy was found carrying a guy inside the community. Maintenance guy was cool, probably the coolest person working there! After your lease... That $200 security deposit right? Bye bye deposit! One of roommate got $154 he called and got everything back. I got billed $137 I called and they told me \"we will get back to you let me talk to my manager\" and nope never called back it's been 2 months now. My roommate (that I shared a room with) got $102. I don't get how they do this? Different amount for different people? If it was a standard cleaning fee shouldn't it be the same amount for everyone? They tried to squeeze money from a bunch of broke college students! If you are trying to save a little money, don't live here. It was just a bad college experience overall. Pick somewhere a little more expensive and you might get the college experience of your life!", "Stonehaven is a really nice place to live in reality despite the negative yelp comments. Our ethernet ports were broken because I guess or previous dumb tenents decided to switch around the board on the ports to mess with whoever was moving in next. So we had no internet for 3 days, and the management team filed a request to fix it with ucr technical team but no one came by for about 3 days. We went back to the management office and they personally decided to come take a look. Thuy from the rso opened up our wall ports and found out they were switched around and she managed to fix the whole thing by herself. We finally have internet now!!!! The management team is amazing!!!", "Both the property manager and the assistant manager Tuhy are so personable and accommodating AND work orders get dealt with really quickly!!! Thumbs up Stonehaven !!", "I live in a single by myself. I have the place to myself, and I love it because I have my privacy and can have people over if and when I wanted to. I also appreciate the service in the front office because every time I need a service or something fixed, they would have it done by the next day. Everyone is really nice if you talk to them. I'd live here again.", "Don't live here!!! WARNING!I never post reviews but after living here for my whole third year it was not worth the money. I had my own room as did my Roomate. I paid over $1000 a month which is almost unheard of for a student and it wasn't worth the money paid. The two ladies at the front are pissed 24/7, and are so fake. They take so long just to give you your mail. I needed books to start my Homework and they kept lagging or wouldn't be in the office. Maintenance guys are quick and good but the front office tries charging you for dumb electricity overrages. At the end of the year I cleaned my whole apartment spotless except for living room carpet and they took my whole $200 deposit and charged me an extra 40$. Most unprofessional ladies working it. THE WORST THING IS THE BLACK MOLD THAT GROWS IN THE ROOMS AND IN THE VENTS. I GOT SICK CONSTANTLY FROM IT AND I AM A VERY HEALTHY MALE. They don't do anything about it too.Do yourself a favor and get a house with some friend and don't live here! Yes it's nice from the outside", "So I have lived here for 2 complete years going on to my 3rd. I can honestly say I have enjoyed my stay here. Thuy Pham and the maintenance staff have been wonderful to me. When I submit work orders, they always do it right away!", "Great condition, my ***. Our apartment smelled moldy all the time (serious health hazard). One day it started drizzling and the waters leaked from the roof through out walls so the wall and the ceiling had to be resealed. Although the maintenance people were nice, It was such a h***le for us. I didn't mind getting my mails from the ladies but now since I live at an actual UCR housing, I can say that I prefer students to handle my packages since it's more efficient. Sometimes, I would have to stand waiting for someone to appear since no one is in the office (and I don't feel judged). At least at Bannockburn, student worker is always there. I also never felt safe here despite the gates. Last year neighbors had series of robberies and break-ins, so that's been fun. Don't believe them when they tell you that this place is safe. Don't forget the plumbing issue. Our toliet never flushed properly and trust me it's not our poop, it's the poor plumbing system that THEY ALSO IGNORE AND BLAME IT ON OUR POOP. Walls are paper thin. Our complaints do not matter because they just want to pocket money from us. Don't be a dumb *** and rent from here. You'll never get your security deposit back no matter how clean you are.Don't be dumb and save money. Go live somewhere else: OBAN, FALKIRK, BANNOCKBURN, ANYWHERE ELSE BESIDES THIS DUMP.No seriously, if you read other reviews you can see that the commonality of our experiences can be summed up as: MOLD, RUDE, DANGEROUS, and BROKEN.This place needs to be burned down and turned into a parking lot.EDIT:People tell me, \"but this place is furnishhhheedddd\"Well, what the hell. Students move out all the time and leave furnitures behind. Also students sell their furnitures for really cheap (like a bed for 40). And plus, after you use it and graduate, you can sell it again. Stonehaven furnitures suck. Punch their couch and you see the dust universe coming alive. NASTY", "I have lived here for 2 years now and renewed for next school year ! I love this place, it's convenient and not a far walk to school. I like that the apartments are gated and not open to the public. The ladies in the office are super nice and chill. One thing I do dislike is not having access to my mailbox 24/7 .", "Awesome housing! The best there is! Stop reading and do your application! Forget about all the negative comments! This is the best housing you can apply. Great environment; clean and more importantly safe. The management is helpful and there for your satisfaction. Don't believe my review go in the office and ask for Sandra....you'll see what I'm talking about.", "I lived here for two years, and over those two years, I learned the meaning behind the phrases \"life isn't fair\" and \"you can't always get what you want\". However, these phrases do not reflect the establishment as a whole, but rather the experience I garnered by living here.Put simply, if you are looking for a reasonably priced FURNISHED apartment close to UCR, you get your bang for your buck. But, if you expect everything to be done your way and expect others to comply, I'm sorry but that won't cut it. Management will do their best to try and ease your discomfort, but ultimately they can only solve Apartment related issues. As for student life, my Resident Advisors the first year were very good. They promoted events and kept things very friendly. The RAs for year two were practically nonexistent. A tip, get to know the management and maintenance crew! They are there to help!", "I am a student at the UCR and Stonehaven is the 'on-campus' apartment that my roommates and I got stuck with because it was the only option for us to stay together. Sure, maybe the initial appeal of Stonehaven is that it is already furnished, looks nice from the outside, and unlike the other apartments on Canyon Crest advertises free wifi.Yet once a student resides here, it all goes south. First of all, there really isin't wifi here...so I guess that was just a lie on the pamphlet...and I consider that false advertising. When I first got here, I had to bring back my Ethernet cable that I had to use in the dorms, yet even then the Ethernet port was pushed into the wall and impossible for me to plug the cable in. I put in a work order for the problem (and getting the form filled out at the office was a less than pleasant experience...but I'll get to that later) but when the handyman came in all he could do was pull it out of the wall and my cable now has to be connected externally. Other than that our closet sliding doors are constantly becoming unaligned and impossible to open and close, we got so sick of it that there came a point where we just removed the doors completely and they were propped up against our living room wall. Sure, we've put in a work order for it which temporarily fixes it but it is an annoying reoccurrence. It boasts to be only built in 2000 making it only over a decade old, yet judging by the interior I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me it was built in the 80's.Secondly, the walls are so thin that I constantly can hear the guy who lives next door listening to music and watching movies. It is so bad that I can even recognize and name the specific song and/or movie that he is listening to or watching. I can also hear the footsteps of whoever is walking down the hallway at whatever hours of the night. Since my apartment is towards the front we also constantly hear people stomping on the stairs, the clanging of the gate, and the tweet of the nearby crosswalk.With the weekly UCPD police crime updates that UCR students get by email, it is safe to say that the Riverside community isin't the safest. Speaking of the gate, the back gate and the front gate are constantly broken. The key is difficult to turn to open the gate, or it gets stuck. Sometimes one can merely push the gate and it will open. If you have a car, Stonehaven parking permits are the most expensive out of all the apartments because the parking lot is gated and comes with a little remote gate opener, yet on numerous occasions we have seen homeless people digging through the dumpsters, who are able to get in by waiting for the gate to open when cars leave or simply letting themselves in through the broken gate. Again, although Stonehaven is an 'on-campus' apartment it is the farthest one and for some reason houses UCR students yet is not managed by the university but by some other company, making the rent payments an extreme hassle. The majority of students rely on financial aid to pay for school and the living expense, but Stonehaven does not care if a student's aid money has come in or not therefore 2 out of the 3 times that the rent has had to be paid this year, I have been forced to pay the late fee. I don't know about you guys, but I nor my family cannot just magically come up with over $1,000. When I first tried to pay rent by check, I nicely went into the office to give it to the ladies that were there, but they rudely told me to go outside and put it in the drop box. When I put in the the box, I saw that it just flew in and landed on the floor. I don't know about you, but I don't feel comfortable with my check for over $1,000 landing in a pile on the floor or God knows where. Saving the very worst for last, the management. There are always two ladies in the office that manage this apartment complex. No matter what you go down to talk to them about, they always to seem to have a pompous attitude. Particularly, the main reason I dreadfully go into the office is to pay rent or to claim packages. One time, I desperately needed a book that I ordered online for one of my classes. I was already behind on readings and used my Amazon Prime account for speedy 2-day shipping. Yet what I forgot to take into consideration it what I'd like to call the 'Stonehaven shipping clause' because even if my package only took 2 days to actually arrive at Stonehaven, it will take them 5 days to process and inform you that your package has arrived, when it's actually just been sitting in the office. Long story short (since Yelp is only allowing me 1500characters) they were very rude to me about about getting my package, and when I proved to them that it had arrived and was signed for, they finally took a second look, found my package and with the excuse, \"Ooops, sometimes we make mistakes, it's inevitable when you have over 200 packages to process\", handing it to me. They need an attitude adjustment or no one will ever renew", "This place honestly deserves Z-E-R-O stars. I REPEAT ZERO STARS!There is a reason why Stonehaven has GOD-AWFUL ratings.But for me, there are MULTIPLE reasons why YOU should NOT live here:1. The management:You're first impression of the property managers when you sign is that they're nice, but when you start to settle down, they're not. But, wait (this is the funny part) when it's time to RENEW your contract, they're all nice to convince you to stay again.  ----I WILL NEVER LIVE IN STONEHAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!-----Also, the two ladies that work in the main office are so damn lazy and rude. Whenever we order packages, it takes FOREVER for them to process it. So if the package was suppose to be here on Wednesday, you'll probably won't get it until sometime the end of next week. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE STUDENTS THAT LIVE IN THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX. Plain and simple.2. Programs:RA's? Where are they, are they invisible?? Anyways, the RA's are lame, and don't do anything to promote social programs. They're ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE at telling people that they're programs, and the events that I do see, are super lame. If you think by living here, it's going to be fun because you'll meet more people through the programs here YOU'RE DELUSIONAL! You'll make more friends just by knocking on random apartment doors. 3. Rent:IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!! That's it.PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! PLEASE. 4. The construction of the apartment: The walls are THIN. You can hear everything; foot-steps, voices, buses and cars speeding down Blaine St and Canyon Crest, and the GATE. The apartment carpet is dirty.5. Front gate: The front gate is CONSTANTLY broken or jammed and it doesn't even open all the way out. 6. Mold:Probably the third time I showered, the bathroom gradually started to smell funky. But we couldn't find the source, until one weekend me and my apartment mate went home, we were welcomed with MOLD on our shower wall. It was DISGUSTING! This place molds really quickly!******DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT LIVE HERE********", "If you are thinking of staying or even living in the apartments this year or the following, I suggest you go find ANOTHER place!!! Negative Reviews:First off, if you need or receive important paperwork, birthday gifts, a gift card of any kind or so, do NOT let me repeat do NOT send anything through Stonehaven. I lost a $25 gift card in the mail, and they said that they have not received it. You may lose your mailsNext, once you move in, take pictures of EVERYTHING!!! They will charge you for the littlest things. I agree with one of the reviewers, they will try to charge you for anything! So be careful! If your not a neat person in general, do not go and if you are a very tidy person like me, be prepared to be charged even if you are a neat freak! Seriously!! When I moved in, everything was dirty and I cleaned practically everything from head to toe! At the end of the year no matter how much you clean, they will charge you even if it was there before you move in. So take Pictures!Bathroom molds A LOT!!! From the corner of the bathroom walls to the bath tub. Gross even if you leave the window open when you shower.People who cannot cook please do not go there! There was seriously over 5 fire alarms this school year, some were in the late evening and one was in 8 in the morning!!! Come on there is a fan on the microwave. Use it!People who work in the office: NOT helpful at all. They want to push everything to UCR Housing department but guess what. Stonehaven is freaking from a Third Party. UCR Housing cannot do anything. These people just don't do their work. They may seem nice but when something goes wrong, they will do anything to get money from you. One of the representatives actually told me that they were being \"merciful\" with the fee I had to pay at the end of the year. I had a small stain in the refrigerator and the bathroom door, no matter how many times I cleaned it, it never cleaned and Stonehaven charged my roommate and I $50 a piece!!! Do you understand this logic?!Positive Reviews:Maintenance guys are very prompt and fulfill any work orders either the same day or the next day. That's all I can say, except maybe that it is furnished but is it worth it in the end?? I hope this review changes your perspective in choosing this housing.", "This place is probably the nicest of the student housing for UCR. Although its pricy, the furniture and appliances are better than most places. The apartment it self isn't bad because it's in great condition and comfortable. The bedrooms are also a decent size compared to other UCR apartments. The only downfall it that its the farthest from campus and the RA don't really do anything.", "High price for a bad place. Everything is always breaking, always mold in the bathroom growing. I've had to evacuate for at least 2 fire alarms a quarter but have never seen an actual fire. The worst part? Tweety, which can you believe is the NAME of the horrible woman at the front desk. She noses her way about your business, makes up arbitrary rules, and generally tries to do as little work as possible while  blaming tenants for everything that goes wrong in the place. I asked people to stop sending me mail so that I wouldn't have to deal with her. I don't know that I can describe how awful she is.", "This place is crap. Don't be fooled by the appearance of stonehaven. The staff may be nice before you sign, but once you sign they are absolute crap.  I have a water leak in my apartment that destroyed some pretty important documents including my passport and degree. They were less than apologetic for the inconvenience and the mildew smell never left the apt. It's also ridiculously loud.  I then moved to the plaza. Which is an older apt. But you save sooooo much money, closer to campus, and you don't have to deal with those incompetent asses.", "I Lived here my sophomore year at UCR and at first it was fine and i had a chill roomate, however as the year went on i could see that i signed a lease from hell.First off, They raised the rent and got rid of cable. The apartments are already too small and expensive, plus you cant have more than three people over per resident because they will write you up(True Story).Secondly, this place is built on an anthill! Ive never seen so many ants in an inhabited space in my life, and i lived quite a few places. Thirdly, EVERYTHING BREAKS. I had to put in multiple work orders and sometimes they didn't bother coming.Next, The office managers are a pain in the butt, but i had to put on a smile and be respectful as they made me feel incompetent for asking why my work order was never attended to, knowing it was their faultAlso, the buildings feel weak, we had a few minor earthquakes and it felt like the building would topple over any minute. They look pretty on the outside but the inside needs ALOT of work. You can tell they cut too many corners and the showers are made for hobbits. Also the smoke alarms go off at the slightest puff. Nobody could cook without the fire alarm going off and it doesn't only go off in your apartment, but it goes off throughout your whole building, which if you live in building A is another pain.Honestly, if you can live somewhere else. Its not worth the 1000 dollars a month with basically nothing included, not even cable anymore, Please look elsewhere and don't live in the most expensive section 8 housing.", "I lived here for a school year and let me say it was terrible. There were ants everywhere, the manager is rude, the toilet backed up, the furniture had suspicious stains on them, including the bed and it was ridiculously expensive. Sandra, the manager in the front office has the WORST attitude ever. She gives dirty looks and attitude for everything. Once I smiled at her and all she did was give me the dirtiest look. Thuy is really nice, if there's anyone you have to talk to, she should be the one you go to. Yes, the apartments come furnished but the majority or them were missing bookshelves and tables that we were supposed to have. Not only that, the tables I received were falling apart and I had to fix them for fear of being charged way too much money. The ants in my apartment were a huge problem and despite my best efforts and those of the management, they would never let up. Also, I warn whom ever that you do not smash the ants with your fingers, they smell terrible when smashed. Don't ask me why, they just do. Though Stonehaven looks nice, it's not. It's over priced for the crappy apartments, the manager is terrible and the furniture is falling apart. Save your self some money and live somewhere else.", "A great place to live if you're going to UCR. The rooms were very spacious and I felt secure because the apartments were gated. The staff was always friendly and helpful. I loved Thuy, she was always super sweet and helpful with any problem that I had.", "I lived here during the summer and at first, after reading reviews and hearing what others had to say, I wasn't sure what to expect. After living here, I can honestly say I had a great experience. For starters, the manager that many complaints were aimed at no longer works here and has been replaced with a much nicer manager. She, along with the assistant manager and the new receptionist, are very approachable and more than willing to help residents with issues. Maintenance requests are completed promptly and the management is more than willing to work with residents regarding payment issues. Overall, many of the issues from previous reviews have been addressed and are no longer a problem. They now even provide free coffee in the morning, free printing, and free ethernet cords! :)", "Pros:Looks well keptAdequate roomCons:Thuy Pham- the shadiest assistant manager I've had to deal with in my short life. She lies through her teeth just to deny it a day later. Proceed with cautionMold seems to grow quite easilyIf you land a first floor room, you'll hear every step above you like a thunderstorm. People walking up and down the stairs will wake you in the morning and late into the night (which might not be that bad if you happen to sleep past your alarm some days).Security is a real issue- none of the security cameras actually work. The front gate is often broken. The gate next to the Canyon Crest entrance has an opening where one can squeeze in.Be wary of who you park next to (especially on thurs-sat nights). Several cars, including my own, have been nicked at the least.There are ant colonies under the establishment which WILL enter your kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, etc. several times a month. Expect it.The maintenance worker (a nice man) mentioned that the quality of the place is.. lacking, and that a lot of things will need to be replaced throughout the year.Odd that I seem to only remember the negatives of the place.. Tells you something, I suppose.", "(if i could give them zero or negative stars, i would) Dont EVER EVER EEEVVVVERRR live here!!!!!! this is the absolute worst place ever. no, the place itself is fine.. its the staff who are absolute MORONS. I have never felt so much anger towards anyone in my life but the staff here has managed to make a believer out of me. Stonehaven is some how apart from the regular UCR housing so they think that they can do and make up what ever rules they want. They are money hungry leeches and have no regard for anyone. Im not talking about maintenance, they are polite but the women who are in the office are very rude. I tried to end my lease here since i withdrew from the university so i informed them a month ahead. They made me get a ridiculous amount of paperwork. Every time i went to turn something in, they asked for something else. Finally, i thought that i had done everything they asked of me and my contract had been cancelled but when i went back to move my things out, the assistant manager told me that they had not approved my lease (when where they planning on telling me this?!). Not only did i have to pay for the month of December (which i did not live in) but they are forcing me to pay for the entire year, keeping my deposit, charging for any \"damage\", and other made up fees they can think of. The situation still has not been solved but i look forward to never having to hear from these people again!!As far as the place goes; the building complex looks decent from the outside. The apartments are in the worst condition ever, there are too many mystery stains to count and dont ever plan on wearing white socks because they WILL turn black. the walls are very thin, if you live next to the stairs you will always hear people coming up and down. Bikes or bike parts are often stolen, even if you have it locked up.

A little pricy for a single room, shared with 2 other roommates. Maintenance is alright, they usually deal with the work order within 2 days, but the problem isn't guaranteed fixed. We had a leaky faucet in the kitchen, and maintenance fixed it for a while, but then it came back after a few weeks. Water runs well, hot water usually comes on within a minute. However, the water in the sink is white for some reason. The kitchen is a little cramped, since usually 2-4 people share it. Maximum of two people can use the kitchen at a time, and the fridge space and kitchen cabinet space is limited. Mailboxes are a little complicated to get to, since I had to ask the RSO where they were. Swimming pool is a little small and dirty even though the staff cleans it daily (could be the residue that it accumulates over the day), but UCR has their own swimming pool too.

Since I just spent the last 6 hours driving down from the Bay, I was in no mood to look for anything else. So I walked into Grand Marc because it was the most convenient at the time. I already lived in UVT my second year of college, and would love to run a bulldozer over the place if I could, so there was no way in hell I was gonna do that. Fully furnished, close walk to everything, utilities included - with wash and dryer in the units, free parking, and etc. Everything was in great condition when I moved in, and remained to be that way for the rest of the year. My randomly assigned roommates and I got along. Pretty good - though pricey. And unlike at UVT, I didn`t have bad experiences with the staff every other day - in fact, I didn`t have any the entire year. Unlike at UVT, I didn`t get my car broken into three times in one week. I know Grand Marc doesn`t have a great reputation in the safety department, but I never had trouble in that area.It`s not great. The prices aren`t exactly fair, and you can definitely find better deals in the area, but in my experience, it`s exponentially better than UVT.", "DON'T LIVE HERE! Grandmarc is by far the worst apartment I have ever had the displeasure of living in. The way this entire group operates business is such a scam. As someone who's been a victim of robberies twice in this location I can tell you personally that security is an absolute joke. Not only were my cases not taken seriously but they took days to respond which didn't allow me to work authorities in a timely manner. Aside from raccoons, skunks and stray cats, Grandmarc is also slow to respond to complaints. There is a large amount of homeless people and locals that are able to come into the property at anytime. They will take large portions from your deposit once you move out. They profit off of exploiting students. Integrity of the entire business is questionable.", "I lived here for three years, in a 2 bedrooms/2 bathrooms apartment. When I first moved in, the apartment was really, really dirty.To be honest, rent is not cheap and it goes up every year. They replaced the old appliances with new appliances for the 4 bedrooms/4 bathrooms, but not the other apartments. I don't understand as to why I have to be paying more rent each year for other people's upgrades. The appliances are old, dirty, and painted over. Last year, when I got back from winter break, the refrigerator broke and I lost about $120 worth of food items. They didn't compensate anything and I haven't even received an apology. They did replace my refrigerator, but to a much older one than I had before, that they found in their \"backup storage\". It was sooooooo dirty, stained, and full of dead bugs.I have to mention all of the ridiculous \"additional charges\". There is a yearly utility fee, fees for this and fees for that. For example, I never missed any rent payments. This month, their SYSTEM had messed up my payment and I got charged for an error in payment. I paid on time and their system stated that I didn't pay, so I paid again. And they took my first payment and then charged me for insufficient funds in the second payment.This year when I got back from winter break, I had another incident. The kitchen sink had overflowed due to a clog from the upstairs or downstairs unit. It smelled so bad and it was absolutely disgusting. They fixed it, but it was my job to the clean the whole place.When I moved out, I had charges on top of charges! They don't realize how much I cleaned that place up. Not because I cared about them, but because it was where I was going to live. I used silicone to cover cracks in the bathroom, I covered the bottom of the drawers, fixed the toilet and bedroom  blinders myself. AND THEY WANTED ME TO PAY FOR CARPET CLEANING BECAUSE I WAS THE LAST ONE TO LEAVE THE APARTMENT? My roommate didn't have to pay for a dime!", "The only reason it I would give it one star is because I had lived here for 3 years. I lived here 2017-2019 school year and then again for 2020-2021. My experience for 2017 was great! That's why I decided to move back in 2020. However, I sincerely regret this decision. The whole apartment was filled with ants they were even on the bed! The apartment was filthy when I moved in so for the move-in inquiry I wrote that there were patches and residue on the walls for the bedroom. When I moved out it all went even worse when grandmarc is forcing me to pay for \"damages\" I did NOT do. I had pictures as prof and they still do not want to take anything into account. They will definitely take advantage of you. I've been trying to fix this for months now and they take 10-15 days minimal to get back. They're charging me $549 for bedroom/bathroom paint, cleaning the bed/bath, common area paint etc. Other than being filthy they have a problem with people breaking in. DO NOT LIVE HEREThis is seriously outrageous avoid this place at all cost.", "Updating the review now that both me and my little sister have lived here. My experience at Grand Marc was by far the filthiest living experience ever. They up charge you significantly for things that are already grimy and gross when you got there. I made SEVERAL complaints on noise, cleanliness and utilities not working and was never assisted. My sisters experience has been basically the same, she has gotten up charged on several things. She was recently notified she had to pay over $180 for carpet stains but my sister is way more meticulous than me and has picture proof of when she left. We are waiting to hear back about that charge. They also claim that laziness and late opening of the front office doesn't usually happen, but it happens ALL the time. I cannot express enough how often I had to wait outside the office anywhere from 10-40 mins for packages and general questions. They need to hire adults that can be there ALL the time, on time.

As in my previous post about their excessive cleaning fee - no one call us back nor email any response. Just want their $. Sad way of doing business. Now I received a renewal insurance policy from MSI. GrandMarc stated need renters need insurance- they recommended MSI. My son cancelled both the lease and renters policy. MSI just billed us for this year insurance for GrandMarc. The sad part is my son cancelled the apartment. Sounds like both GrandMarc and MSI are taking advantage of inexperienced kids. Shame on them!!!", "As a parent of a UCR student, I was truly disappointed with Grand Marc. During past 10+ months, my son & his friends experienced break-in and auto theft INSIDE the secure fencing.

As I mentioned, it was unsafe plus when he moved out - there was $480 'cleaning fee' for each roommate (almost $2000 per apartment. My son took before & after videos - no damages. Grand Marc 'cleaning fee' was excessive and not customary. When we attempted to dispute the charges - never received a response. My recommendation is to never rent from this company- place is unsafe and take advantage of college kids. Shame on them.", "Management is shady af.

When trying to address these issues, there was no help whatsoever from the main office, corporate, or HR. if there are any issues you need help with, good luck getting help here hahaha (most of the reviews are from their own staff to boost their reviews). honestly would not come here u less u want ur privacy violated.", "I have never written a bad review because I'm not a malicious person but this was necessary.

Maintenance made me feel dumb by saying \"oh there's a little bit air coming out so it's working, we don't know why you're saying it's broken\". A small gust of wind is not enough when riverside is 100 degrees+ and my room directly faces the sun. After asking maintenance about this issue multiple times I just gave up and had to buy myself a fan. 2. My food consistently spoiled due to the refrigerator. The refrigerator would not properly cool the food and often leaked all of the floor and the food. I am a college student, with a limited budget. It is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT for me to keep purchasing groceries because it is going bad due to a terrible fridge. We made multiple maintenance requests about this which they would mark as resolved but nothing was actually ever fixed. Our refrigerator continued to function in this way for the whole year. 3. The sofas were disgusting and smelly and ripped up and it took them weeks to fulfill our request for new ones but the new ones were also torn up. 4. The apartment was bug infested and I got regular bug bites. My roommates and I did multiple requests regarding this issue as well but barely got the assistance we needed. We were constantly told oh they are just \"water bugs\" and that pest control would come but pest control did nothing! When I questioned Grand Marc about this they said \"we see on our end that every maintenance request was cleared\". Just because it says the request was completed doesn't mean the issue is gone? As a college student I also don't have the time to be running behind management and maintenance to take care of basic issues, I expect it to be fixed at least the 1st of 2nd time I complain about it. 5. There was dog/human excrement outside of our apartment for months. Maintenance and staff is constantly walking around the apartments, there is no way they didn't see it. They saw it and chose to ignore it. 6. They charged me $500 worth or irrelevant charges when I moved out. The changes consisted of common room cleaning, bed room cleaning, bathroom cleaning, and more. I emailed them back saying I don't feel fully comfortable to pay for some of these charges because of how my living experience was and because I shouldn't be paying a common room cleaning fee when there is currently a resident living there using the common room while I haven't used the apartment all summer. I got an email back from Grand Marc asking to be patient as the account specialist would get back to me but after weeks of not getting a response despite me reaching out again and again, the $500 was removed out of my account without any authorization. I'm not an expert but that sounds ILLEGAL to me. When I called them, they simply blamed reoccurring payments and the website's company. This is not my rent for it to be a reoccurring payment. The reoccurring fees excuse just does not make sense to me because when I had late fees while living in the apartments, money was never just taken out. Instead every month I got charged an additional late fee. If reoccurring charges causes money to just be taken out without authorization from Grand Marc, why wasn't money just taken out when I had late fees? \"Reoccurring fees\" didn't apply then because Grand Marc was making money off the late fees! Do not live at Grand Marc, they will just scam you out of your money. I only lived there because it was \"gated\" but it's not even actually gated because I've seen plenty of homeless people entering in during the day and night and walking around the complex. There are so many better apartment complexes, don't stress yourself by living at Grand Marc because it's the worst!", "Jerry Alfaro is one of the best maintenance guy! He is very hardworking and has a positive outlook! He takes his time to explain what he is doing and extend himself to find a solution to an issue. He is very reliable and approachable, if you're living at Grand Marc I suggest that you ask for Jerry!", "Carlos is super helpful and friendly! He interacted with us while still being able to get the job done quick!!! We appreciate all the stuff he has done around the apartments :) They look nicer than when we first moved in!", "It is a shame that I have to update this with you. But I am changing my five star review because I have noticed a lot of the office staff is under knowledged. The main office staff does great but the younger less experienced office staff needs to verify with management before setting their own rules. For example if you have a rental car you are allowed to take your parking sticker off of your primary vehicle and apply it to your rental car as long as you update the license plate with the office. Lack of this information has cost me $440 in a tow bill from Dynasty Towing who is in cahoots with the security at this location. The security officer was boasting to my roommate that he was getting ready to tow a couple vehicles in the lot as if he felt good about it. My vehicle had a valid parking pass and was registered with the front office but because the parking pass wasn't completely visible from the windshield it was towed.  Grand Marcs lack of communication could've saved me this huge headache and kept my good experience at this location. I had made agreements with Dynasty towing to drop my vehicle for $145 after I showed them there was a valid parking pass but the security guard did not like this and told him to leave and not take my money. Corporal Jenkins is corrupt and feels comfortable taking $440 from college students so he can make whatever he makes as a bonus from the towing company. I am starting to see why all the other reviews makes sense. The security team is making money off parking and the office is making money off of deposits and no one really knows what's going on in the office staff unless they are a manager or have been there for over a year.  It's not that hard for office staff that do not know the circumstances or answers to the question to just admit that and tell them that they will get back to you on your matter but that was not the case. For two weeks I got parking passes on my rental vehicle and still got it towed being a resident at this location", "This has been one of the best places I have stayed. For all the people who have complained about the office and the money do not understand that it requires money to run this establishment and keep things up-to-date. Especially when it is full of college students who just destroy and don't take care of things. Most of the bad reviews on here are because people are impatient or don't follow the rules. If you follow the rules that they lay out for you things go very smoothly. I have sent three emails regarding concerns and they were always taken care of right away. Even if I didn't like the outcome of the result I still understand that there are policies and rules set in the place for reasons and they always approach with a professional attitude. People have complained about Lights not working but as soon as a request as put in it is fixed immediately. Security is always prompt and checking on things. They have a really nice dog park section, basketball court, pool, Jacuzzi, movie theater, game room, gym and other accessories. Parking spaces are a little tight but they work great for with as many people as they fit inside of the parking complex.  Mail is always handled in a proper matter and easy to obtain. The staff is always friendly when I talk to them and have to interact with them. Maintenance has always taken care of request when things need to be taken care of and they are always looking out for our safety. New additions are always being added and the areas are always nice and trash free. The employees here or even stay extra sometimes just to help people out which I think is an amazing example of going above and beyond. Don't let any of the bad reviews of this place for you this place is amazing and they always do the best they can you could not ask for a better group of people to assist you in your living conditions. Just because someone has one bad encounter does not mean this place is not one of the best out there! Make sure you give this place a shot to live Grand! They always throw amazing events for the students at no extra charge giving away free coffee free food and fun activities.", "I couldn't agree more with the previous complaints.  This place is DISGUSTING!!!  The Office Manager hates her life, and makes the residents pay for her misery.  She is rude. Horrible management, I am not sure how she keeps her job.  She is a horrible reflection of the company.  But clearly they don't care about management or their apartments.  I moved my UCR student in and the window security lock was broken, and the toilet didn't work properly.  But how do you rent a place without a working security restraint? They have since repaired them, however the drain system does not allow the water to drain from their bathtub or the bathroom sink.  Mold has grown. Roaches come up the drain so students have to cover it to avoid morning surprises.  We purchased not one, but TWO plug in roach mechanisms and they still don't repel.  Moved in to a kitchen with stuff that seemed to have been splattered from the stove decades ago. Sticky, black, goop all along the kitchen floor, stained carpet that was clearly NOT cleaned prior to moving in. The pool was literally green, so clearly not cleaned.  Amenities.... ew! Homeless people hang out in the trash receptacle area and we have witnessed them bathing in the hot tub.  This has GOT to be one of the filthiest apartment complexes I have ever witnessed.  Security?  We never see security so not sure what the site is talking about when they say patrol.  NOT!  Rent is crazy high, and you get nothing but a filthy, roach infested, roof over your head.  Want to rent? You have been warned, seems by a LOT of people. Do it at your own risk.  YUCK! Wouldn't allow my worst enemy to stay here.", "I moved out since August 27th, 2021. I haven't gotten my security deposit back yet. Final statement list excessive charges for cleaning fees, even the room is already gross when I moved in. I will update this review once receiving my money", "I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The manager teams are so corrupt. The main gate had been broken for a few weeks and nobody fixes that. Mailbox has been completely broken and open for couple weeks, nobody fixes that. Gated community?? Lights on the hallways are flashing. The elevator in my building is broken, it suddenly dropped down a little while I was using it, it feels like riding on a roller coaster! There are no people to check facility and maintain all of these. When I first moved in, capet is full of drinks stain, bathtub and desk was dirty as hell, so many problems, even after I submitted maintenance request, it took me almost a month to wait them come and fix that. Warm and friendly welcome??I'm paying monthly rent $965 for 4b4b which is listed on website with rent $885 plus mandatory meaningless fees(i.e. trash pick up from your door 10 dollars each month, green plus, landlord liability). All they want is MONEY!! With around $1000, I can find so many better places than here. Guess what manager is going to comment on this? Apologize for your bad experience here, but unfortunately you are not recognized as our resident.", "--charged and scammed for a carpet replacement.  I got my money back in a cashiers check from HR Redstone(Carpet was not replaced and I was still charged. When I saw the carpet was not replaced the following year, I had to personally complain to get my money back. They would have never refunded me unless I complained) -homeless people bathe in the water fountain-homeless camp near the front of the apartment complex-skunks, raccoons, and cats being fed in the back of the apartments-rude management-homeless people dig through trash-elevator always brakes down-in my second year of living here, the water shut off often and without any warning-charged $40 for water droplets on the bathroom mirror -multiple break-in emails (One of the pictures I have attached is when I saw raccoons, skunks, and cats all in one area in the apartment complex) They were cute but Id prefer it if I didn't have cats and raccoons walking and sleeping on top of my carI suggest looking at a different apartment complex if you are a UCR studentA PLUS: the maintenance guys are awesome and you know your packages are safe in the office", "Carlos the Maintence guy fixed my shower lickity split.", "5 stars for the maintenance team,they have been great and super caring ,especially Carlos Martines! I've been a resident since fall 2019 and after Several unfortunate situations the Maintenance have been fast and efficient.", "The maintenance technicians are the best! They just came for inspections and made out apartment brand new! From all apartments I've been to, I can easily say grandmarc has the best maintenance crew I have ever met! Shout to Don Chepe the maintenance supervisor! I don't know how grandmarc would run without him!", "Thank you so much Carlos Martinez, thank you for fixing my bath and my fire alarm. You did it extremely fast and very respectfully. Once again, thank you so much!", "This review is dedicated to the maintenance staff at Grandmarc UV! I moved in Fall 2019 and my room had a major leak and the maintenance staff helped mediate the issue. We have had several encounters with unwanted pests (bugs) in our unit and maintenance is always quick to respond to our service requests. Carlos was especially kind and helpful with our latest issue!", "Infested with roaches. Impossible to get rid of them even with very thorough and consistent cleaning. Elevator breaks every day. That's not an exaggeration. It literally gets \"fixed\" every day and breaks every day in B building. Impossible to get to the 4th floor if you're disabled.", "COCKROACHES. COCKROACHES. COCKROACHES. Seeing these bugs is not fun nor enjoyable to anyone. They are literally called pests for a reason. When you put in a complaint, they tell you to put in a maintenance request, and instead of the expected pest control, a maintenance guy comes in and sprays the place down with pest spray that you can buy from Home Depot. These apartments units are disgusting and are not taken care of at all. They say professional pest control comes regularly, yet why are cockroaches still such a big issue? Also, fun fact, the staff calls these pests \"water bugs,\" mind you, these pests are huge. They also say these \"water bugs\"  come from dirty neighbors or you're not keeping your unit clean. We have seen too many occurrences of cockroaches in my unit, and recently I found two in my goddamn bathroom. GrandMarc needs to step it up and own up to the fact that they don't maintain these units and buildings. Professional pest control needs to come into the units regularly, not only coming when requested. I'm no pro with pest control, but something is not right at all with these occurrences. Don't blame it on the people living in the units, do something about it GrandMarc.", "Been living here for 2 years. It's a convenient area close to school and to get around since I don't have a car. The place does come furnished and amenities are covered, so it saves you a bit of money (:", "I would put work orders and they would take forever to come. One time I had to put a work order for the fridge in my apartment and they didn't send someone to fix it until I went to the office in person. By then though my food had already spoiled. When I got my single room they also took two weeks for them to bring my full bed mattress so I was stuck with a twin bed when I had to pay for a single room. Also when I moved out I cleaned the room completely so I wouldn't get charged but they still charged me over $300 for fees that didn't make sense because I left the room in good conditions.", "If I could leave zero stars I would! Teresa, in which I believe is the manager... is very unprofessional! Speaks about others sex lives including hers and uses profanity in front of residents. Keep it to yourself! Aside from that the complex is falling apart and she just works around it as if I don't pay enough to live here and expect the quality of what I'm paying for! This place needs new staff, however some are very sweet and helpful except their useless unprofessional manager.", "It one of best apt if you choose to live near UCR campus. There are some events that u can get free foods. And response here usually is fast.", "I moved in a few weeks ago and it was a disaster. All the furniture in my room was out in the kitchen. I submitted a maintenance request and it has been over a week without any action so I had to move in the bed, desk, closet, and other furniture inside my room myself with help with family.   The couch is totally ripped apart and you can visibly see the leather torn off two of the cushions. The freezer inside shelf broke as soon as I cleaned the interior and the faucet in the kitchen was leaking. My bed was missing three wooden planks and many weren't secured. The bathroom was filthy and the bathtub has brown dot stains that I can not scrub off. The AC seems fine in the living room but there is horrible ventilation and air flow in the bed rooms.  The window screen in my bedroom is also broken.  Currently, I am still waiting for maintenance. Overall, Grand Marc seems amazing with their advertisements, but please do not rely on the photos online and go check out the rooms before making any rent payments. My expectations were set way too high.", "Management is run by scammers. I've lived here for the past 3 years and every year the rent went up, and management somehow got worse. They nickel and dime for everything, even after you move out. Grand Marc looks nice from the outside, but that's about it. If you're moving to the area I would seriously consider living somewhere else.", "Ever since the shift in management this place is GARBAGE. All the \"amenities\" they offer during the tour don't even fucking work. The computer lab printer is ALWAYS broken literally always so don't even try it. They charge for parking now when at one point that was their biggest selling tactic \"the only housing option that offers free parking\" HA! my ass! the students that work in the leasing office are really nice but their overheads are always SO rude & belittle you as if you're not a paying tenant??? Just avoid this place at all costs now that they're under red stone management not worth the price  increase by any means considering they don't give a shit  about their tenants, just your money!!!", "Under new management, things have started to become taken less seriously such as noise complaints. If you have neighbors that like to be loud everyday of the week till hours of 2-3am, the GrandMarc management apparently don't care and won't don't much to assist you. Look for somewhere better that prides themselves in customer service.", "If you have a choice then please don't move in to Grand Marc.  UCR students/renters be aware, don't you trust those beautiful pictures.  The reality is that the place is dirty, run down, the staffs are cold and rude.  They are not there to serve/help you but to only to make money for their boss.  You don't have choice to which room to rent.  It is like a prison, you are assigned to a cell.  It doesn't matter you are paying rent.", "The leasing agents all went out of their way to make sure the process was smooth and we were fully informed on the move in process. This place is much more modern then those of the surrounding area and caters specifically to students. The amenities speak for themselves. This place was definitely was the right choice for me. The grounds are well kept and all the staff was very friendly.", "I reserved the theater for today (Sunday) and told the person at the front office I would show up between 1 and 1:30. She told me someone would be there to unlock the door, and I came at 1:28 and the door was locked with no one in sight. Of course, no one could come to help because the office was closed. She told me they only close the Game Room and Movie Theater on Sundays, but the game room was unlocked! Doors wide open.Talk about poor customer service.", "This is a good place to be for students who attend UCR and/or have work around the area (University Village, etc.) because it's so close by. However, the application and lease signing process is a nightmare. I was planning to live in a four bed, four bath with four other girls, one being my roommate. My roommate and I had the most trouble out of the group because we needed to fill out our applications and sign our leases twice, TWICE, but this place still managed to screw up with them, saying our applications are \"good\" but the leases are \"cancelled.\" Just when my roommate and I were about to finish our applications and sign our leases the second time, we were told by one of the girls that GrandMarc has notified them of getting new people to live with them instead of my roommate and me. I think it's an easier process if you are only going to live in a single room, but if you want a roommate, give this place  a long second thought. I would not recommend it, to be honest. Be careful if you do choose to have a roommate. Came back to update this review, the walls are fucking thin, so you hear people screwing or people showering because of the loud ass water pipes. Also, they chose to update their resident portal at such a bad time when it was close to the day for next month's rent, it screwed me and some of my roommates over since we don't commute and don't have checks to pay rent on time. Just keep checks with you in case because their portal takes so long to fucking upgrade. This place LOVES money (again, who doesn't am I right), all they want is your money.But seriously not worth the $800 for a ghetto, filthy place like this.", "UPDATE: Turns out I was correct that Grandmarc management are SCAMMERS. Grandmarc owes their old management a lot of money and therefore are trying to rack additional charges on all their renters to pay off this debt. Renters BEWARE!! Shady business practices.Original Review:I say living wise this place is great and much better than any other apartments and condos I have checked out and I genuinely enjoyed living here. The issue aren't the apartments, it's management. These people are SCAMMERS.

Many of my other friends who moved out this year also received charges like this even though their apartments were fine too. They will literally do anything to squeeze money out of you, counting on the fact that people that live here are students and aren't super aware.

When my roommate and I first moved in we were very happy with the conditions. Some things were a little run down-the washer was missing a knob, some of the cabinets were unhinged, the carpet was pretty dirty- but altogether it was not bad. The rooms are huge compared to other apartments which is great.The first thing that really bugged me was the lighting. The bedrooms don't have lights, which is beyond annoying. So you have to buy your own lamps. I've lived here for 9 months now and I still flip the light switch every time I walk in. The lighting throughout the rest of the apartment has a green tint which made it feel like a dirty motel. Anytime we turned the lights on we could see so many dead bugs. Real gross.Speaking of bugs, when we came back from winter break, we had an infestation of gnats in our bathrooms, despite both my roommate and I keeping the whole apartment clean. We had no idea where they were coming from. It was disgusting. We've also had 3 separate cockroach incidents which is not a lot but my roommate is terrified of bugs so still not ideal. The couches are AWFUL. They're so cheap. One of our couches was BRAND NEW when we moved in. The leather on that one has peeled so much already. It gets all over the floor. The other couch was not new and was already in a pretty bad state. It's so bad we have bed sheets covering both of them just to try and reduce how much shit ends up all over our floor.Near the beginning of our year here we had a few different plumbing problems. Our dishwasher was leaking out of the bottom and flooded our kitchen. And the faucet in our kitchen had a few holes that caused it to spray water everywhere. However, maintenance was really great about fixing both of those quickly after we had submitted a request. From the balcony of our apartment we had an amazing view of the trash cans. We have noticed a LOT of people going through the trash. They just hop over the back gate all the time. This never bothered us much but it does show that security is not all that great, and just because it's gated doesn't mean only residents can get in. In fact, a lot of people who don't live here come in to use the gym or the pool.The week before spring break there was water all over our kitchen floor that we assumed was from the fridge. Later when we got home from class we noticed the puddle had grown. I looked up and noticed two spots in the ceiling that had drooped down and were leaking water. It was after hours so I put in an emergency request. A guy from maintenance came within the hour and stopped the leak in the attic then said he would be back the next day to fix our ceiling. While I was taking a final the next day, the maintenance crew was working in the attic and one guy fell through. They patched the hole up with cardboard until the ceiling could dry. When we came back from spring break the hole was somewhat fixed but they still came in a few times to paint. After spring break was when we became very frustrated with the appliances here. During spring quarter our AC has broken 3 different times. The heat in Riverside is unbearable without air conditioning. Plus if maintenance doesn't come before the week is over you have to wait the whole weekend until they'll fix it. Whenever this happens we have to leave all the windows open, my bedroom window doesn't have a screen so I hate leaving my window open for flys and wasps to fly through. Also before this quarter we never went over the electricity cap. But because we've been keeping our fans on 24/7 to try and keep the place cool we've had to pay more on top of our rent. Not much, but still annoying.Small issues: Occasional power washing often leaks into entryway of the apartment. Elevators are dirty and slow. The hallways have hair and lint all over them. The walls are thin, I can clearly hear all of my neighbors conversations.With all this in mind there are definitely some pros to grandmarc. The apartments are really spacious which is super nice. Washer/dryer is included. It's pretty close to UCR and the UV. They have a pool, gym, theater, study rooms, game room (but so do all the other apartment complexes.) They have events with free food for the residents. Parking is free, but their guest parking system sucks. They don't allow pets which sucks but luckily they aren't very strict, so many people have dogs. I've never had a problem with the staff being unfriendly or unaccommodating.FINAL REVIEW: Not worth what you have to pay. My roommate and I are paying $1069 each every month and grandmarc doesn't really offer anything that you can't get somewhere else for way cheaper.(Also pretty sure this place is haunted.)", "Nice complex close to the college! Great specials right now too!!! Love the pool and the theater", "I've lived at Grand Marc for 3 years. When I first moved in I had no real complaints with the apartment other than the tile area in the kitchen still being dirty, the couches were disgusting, and I saw a few roaches. To give Grand Marc credit, they did eventually replace the couches. Additionally, I only ever saw 2 roaches in my whole 3 years at Grand Marc, but I think that's due to me being a bit of a clean freak in the common and bedroom area (you can still see a bunch in the corridor areas at night). I also had generally positive interaction with the front office. They were friendly when I came by to pick up packages or mail. However, I was incredibly disappointed when I had to learn that the apartment next to me had been robbed from the tenants living there and not the front office. They did eventually respond by sending a generic \"Be careful and lock all you windows\" email. A personal assurance from staff to alert the neighbors of the robbed residence would go a long way and mean a lot to residents imo. The maintenance workers were also great and they fixed issues within a reasonable response time. Security is fine, but they don't do much other than walk around and are really only there for show. I had a bike stolen in one of the outside bike locks, so for a lesson to those reading I recommend keeping your bike in your apartment.My biggest complaint (and the crux of this review) is the situation upon moving out, where Grand Marc checks your apartment and assesses fees. Personally, I feel like I kept my room and bathroom generally clean (i.e. no stains, paint scuffs or holes, etc.). Before I moved out I even took extra time to make sure I cleaned up especially well. Despite my efforts I was sent a bill from Grand Marc to the tune of 200+ dollars (the exact amount I can't seem to remember). Honestly, this is bull. I can't say for certain, but it almost feels like Grand Marc is making me pay for maintenance (i.e. carpet replacement/cleaning, tile replacement/cleaning, etc.) that they should naturally be accountable for when a resident of 3 years moves out of their unit. Do they expect an apartment room to be in the same condition as when I first moved in there in 2016? Will the carpet or tile not wear with age? Personally, I believe they were in good condition still. If there were really damages to the carpet or tile that needed replacing then why were these never noted in the inspections they perform and done earlier?At the end of the day what I believe is bull doesn't matter. I signed the contract and it says I need to pay, so I did. Disputing them would get me nowhere. This doesn't change the fact that it has soured my overall experience of living here considerably. Honestly, I don't believe it's worth living here for 800+ a month and if you have other options you're looking at then I urge you to consider them. Not all the 1-star reviews here are reactionary and I believe they are legit and should be taken into account by prospective tenants.TL;DR - as a living experience, Grand Marc is okay. Though I'm not entirely sure it's worth the price you pay for rent and the inevitable move-out fees.", "Management is terrible and unhelpful. They allowed my roommate to break into my room and steal my things multiple times. I brought up so many issues but they clearly only care about the money. Customer service is awful. I would not recommend this place to live in. Horrible insect problems and maintenance issues. Does not care about their residents at all.", "Thinking about living here? DON'T!!! I thought it was worth it to live here at first because of all the amenities, but it is NOT SAFE to live here. Someone broke into my apartment and stole my items WHILE I WAS IN THE APARTMENT. Living here gives me anxiety. Every night I hear creaks throughout the apartment and start to panic because I think someone is breaking in. I couldn't even live here for a whole month after the incident because I was traumatized and still am and wasted $800 in rent for nothing. You may be thinking this has nothing to do with the apartment... WRONG! Yes, it's not their fault something like this could have happened, but THE AFTERMATH is their problem. First, when the incident happened security came to talk to me and asked me \"when did this happen?\" I told him around 7:35 PM and his response was \"oh my god no way i checked in at 7:00 PM\" ... THAT'S IT. They need better security and security cameras. Next, I went to the office the next day to file a report and talked to the manager and she ensured that safety was her priority. She told me they were going to install motion light sensors in the ally... SURPRISE THEY'RE STILL NOT THERE (3 months later). She also said they were working closely with the police. I asked a lot of questions and she said she could provide an email with a recap with her meeting with the police. During the meeting with her I asked about ending my lease because living here wasn't worth it anymore. The next day I get an email about ending my lease... not about the meeting with the police. It just shows management here really doesn't care about what happened to you. No one has ever contacted me to see if I needed anything or am okay. All they care about is money. Lastly, I had to get a new room door because the robber completely broke my door by forced entry and maintenance replaced it a few days later and left a complete mess not even bothering to clean it up. For your information, there have been at least 5+ robberies in the last year... You may think this would never happen to you, but you never know. (Even someone that lived on the FOURTH floor got robbed.) How many robberies will it take for GrandMarc to do something about this? My life was in actual danger and they still haven't done shit. DON'T LIVE HERE!", "they deleted my original review and it wouldnt let me repost my review from my page so I had to use my friends account to repost it. Honestly wasn't the biggest fan of living in GrandMarc but i just shut my mouth and dealt with it because i really liked a couple of the employees in the front but management continues to cross lines they're not supposed to. It's extremely dirty, theres severe ant problems everywhere, they have hornets and wasps nests on balconies, all of their rooms are stained with some type of nasty stuff either on the carpet or the bathtubs. dont get me started on the random peoples hair permanently painted on all the walls because management was too lazy to clean the walls before repainting them. just be aware they don't clean the apartment AT ALL when you move in, it was so gross when i moved in And watch them still charge me a ridiculous cleaning fee even though I'm the one who went in and paid to get the room deep cleaned with my own money since they were too cheap to. They don't take our valet trash when they're supposed to even though we pay each month for it? Lol because they didn't pick it up once on their scheduled days we got maggots in front of our door. the trash valet man helped us clean it up, even tho it's 100% managements responsibility (we called and told management the next day they didn't care). The only good thing about GrandMarc is the maintenance crew, they're extremely extremely sweet and so helpful and so is the trash valet guy. It's the management that's terrible tbh. Their lease has the stupidest rules, they tried to tow my car because i didn't have my new registration stickers on them since they were on the way in the mail. Where else am i supposed to park my car in the meantime? I live here lol. And what does my registration have to do with GrandMarc? Called and asked and they said it's just a requirement in the lease otherwise you'll get towed. They fiend for ways to steal your money, 50 dollar key cards if to replace yours, 10 trash valet every month even though trash sometimes doesn't even get picked up. You're not allowed to put YOUR own belongings on the balcony Lmfaoo. \u00a0Can't even have any plants. They got mad at everyone about putting stuff on THE BALCONY WE PAY FOR. they told us to remove our belongings our they'll charge us, surprise surprise. The reason why they have all these \"events\", which btw only people who don't work can go to, is because they need to justify their extremely high prices. They desperately need money so they also religiously tow cars, it's illegal to tow once the car is in possession and control of the driver but GrandMarc management does not care they'll do it regardless of it's illegal or not. They only stop if YOU know your rights. They can do all that but we can't even keep a plant on a balcony we pay for lol. please know your towing rights if you live here. They have the tow truck guy waiting around the corner while management runs around trying to find someone to tow. the whole \"parking pass\" thing is just an excuse to tow cars, they only allow you to get 1 guest pass per day and it has to be during 9-5 pm so if you work or if your guest Comes over spontaneously \u00a0after 5 pm or if you have multiple guests, y'all better get ready to get towed and pay 400+ . Their office isn't even open when I've gone to pick up parking passes in the middle of the day so my guest had to end up stressing over parking because management won't even keep their doors open all day (Happened more than once). Don't let one positive review fool you like it did me. Cuz now I'm complaining about the same EXACT thing a year later. really wish i would've just listened to the reviews, didn't know they'd be this accurate. Definitely not renewing my lease again. it's almost luxury prices for a non luxury apartment in a dangerous area where the gates are always broken and anyone can walk in. Again only good thing was maintenance so shoutout to them. Also someone said that most of the bad reviews are from impatient people or people who don't follows rules. So is every one of these bad reviews a lie? Walk up to anyone at this apartment and ask them if they like it and You'll get your answer. No need to blame the tenants when it's the management who has had a notorious streak of being terrible for years. I've lived in apartments in riv w the same price point, better management and absolutely no problems at all.  Been living here for less than a year with so many problems and we all can't wait to get out.Useful 1FunnyCool", "terrible place, super infested with insects of all kinds. Had cockroaches falling out of the AC vents. Flies and fleas everywhere. I would give it 0 zeros in all honesty. The fridge does not work well, lights are broken and very grimy.Toilet had a constant sound and no one came to fix it regardless. No lights in the room so that is a pet peeve. Had to use lamps to light everything. Not a great place to even study which is essential... Staff that do either respond or just reply with \"it's not their fault\" makes residents pay for such things. Overall do not choose to live here, you can find another place.", "I AM SO GLAD WE ARE MOVING! As close as this location is to campus, the bad outweighs the good. This company pours so much money into their front office to trick potential costumers. Dingy carpets, worn out cabinets, and loud parties every weekend, it's one too many straws to deal with. I love to clean and live in a decent environment but there are some things that cleaning cannot prevent. The idiotic floor plans for these units are a good place to start. The gate provides no security since anyone can easily tailgate and park here without a permit. Almost every unit has extremely sensitive fire alarms so you can never use your oven. Forget about affordability since you're probably going to end up in a 4 x 4. Have fun with a moldy bathroom ceiling since barely any units get a window in their bathroom even when running the bathroom fan. Oh, and if you're lucky, you get to enjoy having a mysterious pipe in your bathroom ceiling that drips AC coolant when you're trying to fight the Riverside heat. You've been warned.", "There was a problem with the room we got upon move in, but Teresa was seriously as accommodating as they come. She helped us out as quickly as she could, always got back to us, and showed compassion for the tough spot we were put in. Really grateful for the service we got.", "Grand marc doesnt really care about the tenents. I live here now and i would give anything to get out of my contract. Its dirty and filthy underneath the beautiful paint job. Im dizzy right now from the fumes that were created by \"maintenance men\"that the \"new management\" sent over to fix my dirty broken microwave. They refuse to fully replace any appliances or carpets in the \"common area\" bc when you sign the lease \"you have accepted the apartment as is\". This is garbage. Dont do it.Sincerly , a college student", "From the moment I stepped into the leasing office on my first day of touring apartments, i knew grand marc was the place for me. Not only was the staff extremely welcoming (especially allen) and helpful, the apartment complexes also made me feel right at home. I love the fact that grand marc is the only place nearby that has individual washers and dryers included in each apartment. When I graduate and move out I will especially miss the events that occur almost every week such as, taco tuesday, corny wednesday, and so much more. Grand Marc has become my home away from home for three years and I wouldnt have it any other way.", "There are a multitude of issues with this place 1) Overpriced living arrangements its about 800 bucks a room! Not for the entire apartments so if you think about it if you get a 4 room apt the rent will be 2,400 a month! 2) Management and the Keystones aren't helpful, can be super rude, and are generally very lazy! 3) Their staff that \"fixes\" things in the apartments dont know what they are doing half the time and have parties of their own blasting mexican music in odd hours while getting drink (yes THEY LIVE there too!)4) Hobos sleep by the trashcans and by the pool area! (remember now your paying 2,400 a month and this is all going on)5) TOWING is a CONSTANT thing! Cars get towed even when they have a permit showing at times! They are sketchy! Also in able to get a parking permit for a visitor its a long process and is a real bitch on weekend since they are only good for ONE day. (if you want to stay the weekend with a friend over...chances are their car WILL get towed. This is not a possibility it is a fact. I got my car towed when the sticker was ON my car for being a resident and they will still bit*ing at me to pay.....I didnt but it was hard to get out of it. 6) There is constant turning off of the water (at least once a month) 7) When you move in the apartment is not even CLEAN! WTF! My roommate still had a toilette with crap in it when she moved in, the walls had rust all over them and the bath had mildew all over it8) The couches are sunk in a have holes in them 9) Your Bike WILL get stolen if its on the racks! even on the balcony...so LOCK your bikes u if you live here i had a friend who's bike was stolen from the THIRD floor! WTF! Mu bike was stolen twice and a third time almost happened10) The security is lazy! I told them about possible bike thieves and they didnt do anything..guess what..next day more than 50 bikes were stolen in one night.....Getting past \"security\" 11) When the security guards offer week in exchange for entrance into the complex there is a problem......I feel scared OF the security when they should be protecting us not making us feel more unsafe. DO Not let the main office and the demo room fool you....This place is disgusting and they take your money away and do not give you good service. Seriously check out Stone Canyon Apartments and if you dont have a car try out Reddington where you can save your money and get MUCH better quality. If there are more than 4 severe things wrong with the place so not rent here...this place has 11!!!!! Im probably forgetting many but please.........dont live here. Its not worth it.", "If I could give it a negative star rating I would. THIS PLACE HAS HIDDEN FEES!This place is the worst place a person can live in. The management of this place is terrible. All these people want is money and they don't care about their residents. I lived there for two years and I regret it. The first year they had a pipe leakage that took literally 2 weeks for it to finish. The wall inside my room was filled with mold and mildew. The blonde woman, who I think runs this place, told me to still live in my room when living conditions were not livable. Who the hell wants to sleep in the same room where mold was growing? Need a work order done? Wait a week and call 5 times. Then they'll come and fix it. Fire alarms are out of battery? Well you're shit out of luck because you have to listen to that thing goddamn beep for a week before they come and fix it. The maintenance guys for this place is really nice, but since management is bad, it still takes them 2 weeks to get things done. It's like they purposely understaff their maintenance team. This is the perfect place to live if you like to fix things yourself or love things broken. This place also hire the most useless interns ever. They will tell you things that are not true, or they will go back on their words. They are also the most lazy interns ever. When I saw the intern putting in the mail, she was actually just sitting next to the mail box talking with a box of mail next to her. What a great staff eh? THIS PLACE HAS SHOOTINGS. At least once a week there will be a fight outside my window consisting of around 30 people. Obviously it would be 1:00AM in the morning and people would be screaming outside. The security guards they hire doesn't do anything, and cannot regulate any crowd if their life depended on it. Anyways, random bullets was fired and the crowd ran for their lives. Riverside cops had to show up and take control of the situation. Actually, Riverside cops are always in the parking lots because of these type of events always occur. So if you like living life on the edge and love that adrenaline rush, live here! They had one security guard they hired that actually did his job. So what did grandmarc do? Oh that's right, they fired him. (or this place was so bad he quit. because you know, life is more important than working at this death trap.) This was the man who would tell bikers to lock up their bikes in their rooms because people would be clipping bikes and stealing them, especially road bikes. This was also the man who would help you carry things to your car because he sees you carrying three boxes trying to get to your trunk. Instead, grandmarc fired him and hired some other asshole who doesn't do anything. Speaking of security, the gate system is flawed. The gate is always broken within 3 weeks of fixing it. And I mean all the gates. So a homeless man can be chillin' in the jacuzzi for all you know. Ps. their jacuzzi had sand in it the last time I went in. This place is dirty. The pool is always dirty filled with dead bugs and misc things. Yay for swimming with dead bugs. FREE PRINTING? Yes free printing when they decide to fix the printer. For a full year, the printer has been broken. So you better have less than 10 pages to print and have to be within the times they open & close! Have a paper due at 8 and need to print at 10? well tough shit, you can't do that unless you have your own printer. So, remember when I said hidden fees? Yes, this place has hidden fees. When you signed that contract, you were suppose to read all 50 pages. On your move out date, you will receive a bill of $30+$45=$75. Isn't that lovely? You're thinking hell yeah, I'm done with this place then bam you have almost a hundred dollars to pay just because they said so. How did I find out these were hidden fees? Well I went in and talked to one of their employees. Matt E. He's the guy who finally have his own office after all the years he's been working there. He will be nice to you if you're hot. If you're not so hot, he's a dick/douchebag. Well, first I went and asked one of their useless interns, and they told me GRANDMARC DOES NOT CHARGE ROOMS, go talk to Matt. Okay, I went into his office and ask. He told me OH THESE FEES WERE CHARGED TO EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE NO MATTER WHAT. I cleaned my room every week. I left it clean when I moved out. Well they don't give a shit about you, pay the damn fine anyways! All that cleaning and you still have to pay. Bullshit. Right? So if you're moving out, don't bother cleaning THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR CLEANING apparently. Ps. if you have a car it might get dinged from other people's car doors or something. I found random smalle scratches/scrapes randomly during my time there. Or you know, the car can just get stolen like the bikes. This place sucks, go live somewhere else", "Moving in here after living in the dorms was one of the best decisions I've made thus far. This place is fully furnished and also includes several amenities such as a pool, gaming room, study lounge, and even its own gym! The workers and leasing agents are very friendly and easy to talk to. Grand Marc's location is one thing I quickly fell in love with. The Bus Stop is just across the street and Campus is just a 15 minute walk so getting to school is never a problem for me. I do not regret choosing Grand Marc over any other apartment complex or house.", "If you're familiar with Riverside, you know that University Village has some awesome food spots and is clutch to live by. GrandMarc is literally across the street from here. What I really like about GrandMarc is that even though the place is pretty big, the staff there really give everyone personal attention for any housing needs. The pool there is really nice and there's even a hot tub. There's also a movie theater for residents that you can rent out which is pretty great for sporting events like the Superbowl or NBA. I checked out all the nearby properties and this one was my favorite, mainly due to how clean the place was and the friendliness of the staff. It's literally kind of like a resort and is what you'd imagine for a place in Cali. I think a lot of the negative reviews are from the old management but that's since changed. I would recommend this place if you attend UCR and want to live with your close friends.", "A great place to live if you love getting robbed!The fake security cameras also really add to the aesthetic of the place", "Save your money. Don't rent here!!!! You can find a nicer place for cheaper than the grandmarc. The rooms, hallways, pools, elevators, etc. are all filthy. Someone peed in the elevator yesterday and even after a call it took 2 days to have it cleaned. My room had stains all over the carpet and the wall paper around the sink was moldy and peeling. The office workers are particularly unhelpful, rude, and unorganized. These office workers made moving in the worst experience possible, it took up to 3 hours standing in line in the sun in 100 degree weather to get my apartment keys. Several employees were rude to me while getting parking passes for visitors and right before moving out one employee called me a liar when I said my key broke.", "As my time here at Grand Marc comes to a close, I've decided to leave an updated review on my experience living here. Three years ago, old management was, for lack of better word, pure sh*t. They sucked students into leasing with them and rent was upwards of $800 for a 4-bedroom apartment. Since then, rent has at least been lowered to a competitive rate of about $670 for the same 4-bedroom unit. That's a competitive price that is matched by surrounding complexes as well. The perks of living here:- rent pays for housing and utilities (within $30 for electricity)- close to campus and the UV, so you can grab a quick bite or run to 7-11 for whatever your needs are- free parking per person- pool access- Amazon locker available 24/7- renovated gym with updated equipment- computer room with 2 study roomsNow given the perks of living here, there isn't much to complain about. BUT, if you get the short end of the stick, here is what you could deal with (and these were some of my biggest problems):- GUEST PARKING IS TERRIBLE!! They have the dumbest possible system with parking so that you can only get a permit for your guest within the times that the leasing office is open. If you can't come in during that time, you're shit out of luck and your guest has to park outside the premises at the UV. you also can't ask for an extended permit if your guest stays for more than one night... You have to come in everyday at 12pm or whenever the office opens in order to get a new permit every time. Talk about inconvenient!- Security doesn't do their job. It's quite evident that non-residents like to come into this complex but security doesn't stop them from coming in. Often times I found non-residents loitering the pool area. - A lot of parties happen in this complex so if you have a neighbor who likes to get down, you're probably not gonna get any shut eye. - High theft! My friend lived on the first floor and was robbed while she was in her own bedroom and the thieves ransacked her living room IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. - Wi-Fi is T E R R I B L E ! Don't let those signs fool you. Airwaves is complete crap and with the amount of residents sharing the wifi it's definitely slow. All in all, living here wasn't a complete nightmare but it wasn't a dream either. The living situation isn't too bad, the maintenance workers come and repair things quickly, but if there's one thing this apartment complex can never get right it's their CUSTOMER SERVICE. For the amount you're paying to rent a room here, I would highly suggest taking your business elsewhere.", "I have lived here for over two years and I have had absolutely no complaints UNTIL this year. When the new management arrived everything got progressively worse. Advertisements for fast wireless internet? That's obviously a lie. It's even SLOWER than it used to be and I can't even get 5 GHz of wifi anymore than when I used to. Electricity caps at $30 per room occupied and even though I've NEVER been charged for the last two years of living here, somehow now that we have NEW management I'm getting varied monthly charges without an explanation as to why. When I called, they said it was conservice and that there was no way to determine who was using more electricity. Case in point, old management said we were charged individually for our own room, new management said we were charged as an entire unit. ***BETTER HAVE ROOMIES THAT ARE FINE WITH SUFFERING IN THE HEAT CUZ GOD FORBID YOU USE THE AIR CONDITIONING AND GET A SURPRISING FEE AT THE END OF THE MONTH.***Old management never charged me for transferring from one unit to another. I had a particularly extenuating circumstance and they were sympathetic to my plea and let me move into a new one. However with new management, gone are the days of transferring. Can you say greedy bastards? Because new management is all about taking your money! Transfer fees from unit to unit now cost $200 and who in their right mind is gonna pay $200 to switch rooms...Oh and if that doesn't make things better, if you try to break a lease well SORRY because that's not possible anymore. Old management allowed you to either find a replacement or pay a $300 cancellation fee but new management prohibits the cancellation of a lease AND will charge you $300 to find a sublease. \"Better\" management? If I have to pay the entire year's worth of rent to \"cancel\" my lease then what the hell is the point of moving out in the first place???This monthly rate is by no means excessive. They charge a competitive rate and try their best to lure students into signing their lease. My recommendation is to look for another apartment. At this point, I would rather inconvenience myself and pay a higher rent that's further away than deal with the absolute bullshit that Grand Marc imposes on their residents.", "Honestly living here is alright but the amount of problems that I've had here is ridiculous. It does get pretty annoying when flies just start popping out of nowhere in the kitchen. The appliances break down every now and then and the wait to get it fixed is pretty time consuming on your part. But the main problem that I have is being charged when I get locked out of my apartment when there's a malfunction with my card key. I really have to pay to get into my apartment when it's not even my fault that my card key was not working. So if you tend to just misplace your keys or something I'd recommend not living here and just sublease someone's room at a house instead.", "I've lived here for a few months now and it's great. The poo, and movie theater are really cool and every room has its own bathroom. Definitely worth giving a look if you're searching.", "Okay for starters, the place is a WRECK. Everything is so dirty, there are bugs everywhere and it's literally worse than the projects. Their cheapest rooms are about $800. Do you really want to pay $800 to live in filthy apartments where everything is literally broken? Then be my guest and move to the grand Marc. The staff is HORRIBLE and disrespectful. They don't know the meaning of customer service. They are never there to help anyone and even when they get around to do their jobs they do the worst job imaginable. Your toilet is clogged? Might as well buy a porta potty or rent a bush somewhere for a whole month. Your ac isn't working? Buy a damn fan and live in a fridge for the rest of summer because no one is going to give a shit. They just had a leak and every apartment is flooded. Good bye to all your valuables. They aren't covering their damage. Their solution is to send everyone to the plans, the most ghetto apartment complex known to man where there were shootings all summer. Oh and you STILL have to pay your full rent because \"it wasn't their fault\". This is literally the worst experience you will EVER have at any apartment complex. I highly recommend saving your money and living in your car if the grand Marc is your only option. Seriously, a cardboard box will be more comfortable.", "Honestly I hate it here ! Don't waste your money they threaten to fine you for everything .!!!!You also have to pay for parking permits. Looking at all the previous reviews I'm scared to move out because I don't want to be charge for bogus fees . They give you a apartment checklist to be turned in within 24 hrs of moving in . That gives you no time at all to look over damages . I've had two really bad leaks since I've moved in of February of this year . They are rude in the office and the employees are always giving mis information and when you call them out about it they get mad .  I've heard nothing about robberies that have been happening which is scary ! You are better of renting a room or living with your parents . They know students do have a lot of money but they charge people for every little thing . Listen to all the bad reviews everyone's not lying this place is trash along with there employees . Run and don't look back !", "Lived here for 3 years. Dont live here unless you want to get scammed when you move out. Got charged $800 for unnecessary reasons. The company owes money to their old management and everyone I know who moved got charged hundreds of dollars. Furniture is old and cheap. There are many better apartment complexes to choose from. Don't waste your time or money.", "I love living here! i have lived at Grand Marc during my second and third year of college and I am also planning on living here my fourth year. The amenities are great. I live in the upgraded unit and it is worth every penny. The upgraded unit flooring and lighting is definitely a plus. The management is friendly and inviting. I would highly recommend living here.", "This is my second year living at grandmarc. Definitely has its ups and downs. Let's start with the cons. To start off, the tipping point that prompted me to write this review is what happened recently. There has been a string of robberies happening in the apartments and thieves are still at large. The prime targets for these robberies are A B E F buildings. And what do you know, I live in building B. I heard about the robberies through my roommate because their friends got robbed and we called the front office to ask about it because literally no one is home is freaking check and we all live fairly far from riverside. They legit couldn't tell me jack shit about my unit and just said \"keep you doors and windows locked\". Okay first of all, when we all left, WE FUCKING DID. WE FUCKING TRIPLED CHECKED. they do fucking quarter inspections and fucking leave EVERYTHING ON AND UNLOCKED SOMETIMES. THERE HAS BEEN COUNTLESS TIMES WHERE I WALKED IN TO MY UNIT AFTER THE INSPECTION AND EVERYTHING FUCKING LIGHT IS ON AND THE BALCONY DOOR IS UNLOCKED. LIKE CAN YOU FUCKING NOT. Sometimes they come in without prior noticed... like bitch.... when they do their inspections they say shit like keep the living room empty because it's a common space and everyone should use it and shit. Well.... what if we fucking collectively agreed to have shit there as decoration?! We rented the place for a year, how we deal with our place within that year is none of your fucking problem. Bill me at the end of my lease or something don't be micromanaging shit. Since no one is home and they won't tell me shit about the unit, I am in constant fear and super anxious about it since I have irreplaceable things inside. I SHOULD NOT FEEL LIKE THIS WHEN IM ON BREAK AT HOME. so much for \"a home away from home\". I can assure you I do not feel like this when I leave MY home for a long period of time. Another thing is, their security is SHIT. soooo fucking shit. They legit don't do anything but go on their phone. Sooo many fucking people follow residents in and they just sit there on their phone. I remember one night distinctly, there was a crazy party in my building and we called security about a noise complaint because it's passed 12am and myHousemate and I have 8am the next day. The security was like okay we will go check it out. After 30 min NOTHING HAPPENED. within 2 hours, my housemate and I called probably collectively called 7 times and the party just got louder.... I had to call the fucking police to stop it... their management fucking sucks. They literally do not care and when you ask questions they fucking give you attitude. BRING BACK JOE! If I find any of my things, I'm holding grandmarc responsible. I have my lifeline in my unit. You might ask well why didn't I bring it home... the answer is simple. Grandmarc is my home in riverside, what I leave there is none of your fucking concern. Why should I ever have to think, \"will one be home for a month... time to pack up my entire room and go home because grandmarc is unsafe\". You know those security cameras outside? Well they don't work and theyre too lazy to fucking fix it. Can't really complain about maintenance since there are only 5 of them working on 200 units. They should really hire more since they're charging a fortune for rent. Now for the pros. I guess they feed you once a while so that's cool? There's free WiFi, all you have to do is buy a router. And the last redeeming quality is, there's free parking... but with the thieves there... I'm scared my car will get smashed into.", "I've lived at grand Marc since last July now. The company has been nothing but open and helpful every step of the way. I love living here, it is extremely convenient and also the staff is very kind. The price is very reasonable especially considering all of the amenities that come with it.", "First of all I want to say if I could give it a half a star I would but I can't so one star will do. I lived here for two years 2017-2018 and then 2018-2019. The first year when I moved in the carpet in the room was disgusting to say the least. There were mounds of hair and you could tell by moving the furniture inside the room that  had not been cleaned in a while because you could see the outline of dirt. Fast forward to the end of my first year and I tried to renew but they had already given away my room for next year so I was freaking out trying to find somewhere to live. Luckily someone needed to get rid of their lease so I took over. Now let me tell you how difficult that was. Not only did they increase the rent for me because apparently I had to get the rent at \"market price\" but they made me pay an extra $200 dollars as a \"transfer fee\" even though I wasn't transferring anywhere I was just taking over a new lease. This new room I got was a complete downgrade from the one before and I was paying a lot more. It was dirty and a lot of things were broken. There were issues with the common areas too as well as the kitchen and laundry room. It was miserable living there because the management wouldn't do much about the quality. When I finally moved out they sent me a bill trying to charge me for replacing the carpet and cleaning the bathroom when it was a mess before I moved in. All the good reviews you see in Google are fake. They make people write good reviews in exchange of a $5 Amazon gift card. Also don't he fooled with the \"amenities\" the pool is always dirty, the hot tub never works, and the tanning beds are never available. The gym always has broken machines. The only decent things are the game room and business center. I wouldn't recommend living here honestly. It's not worth your money AT ALL.", "Living here was a really great experience compared to the last place i lived at. The rooms are a lot more spacious and Its always maintained and kept decently clean not to mention it being safe since its a gated complex. Also the staff there are all really nice and helpful and I had a lot of fun getting along with them whenever there were events and food by the pool and incentives and free gifts! Also the pricing is not bad at all since all the ammenities and utitlies are included. I definitely would recommend this place to other people and future students!!", "If I could then negative stars I would. I was fooled by there lavish exterior and resort like complex but please don't be fooled like me and my roommates were. My stay there was nothing less then a nightmare I felt scared to sleep at night knowing the countless break ins occurring and security on sight nothing was being done and handled correctly. They DONT care about there tenants only about money and there image. I thankfully steered many of my friends away from signing a lease here and they told me that during their tour that Grand Marc dismisses all of their concerns and straight lied saying it's very safe here and break in weren't an issue even though during my stay we had more break ins then I can count on my hands. This was just many of the never ending list or horrors that is Grand Marc. They finally changed there management but again don't be fooled they are no better. I moved out and just as I expected and read on other people's yelp reviews they r are charging me falsely for moveout expenses that they should be responsible for as the only slight damage was due to flooding which happened twice and they did absolutely nothing about. It's just a disgusting company from it's management staff organization professional and the unit itself. You get your keys and you have to clean it yourself before moving in even thought they claim they have professionals clean before move in your unit will be gross dirty and dusty. There's so many of problem with grand Marc I'm surprised someone hasn't shut them down but again they are just taking advantage of kids in college and stealing there money. I payed almost 1,000 for my bedroom and after getting to know my roommate she only pays about 800 I wouldn't live there even if someone paid me. They rip everyone off and on top of that they have raised there rent even more since I left, if you wanna pay 1,000+ to live in a nightmare of a lease I would recommend Grand  Marc. The new place i live now conviently one of the management at my new property used to work for Grand Marc and he just confirmed all my concerns and theories that Grand Marc does not give a F about there tenants only money and there image!My best advice besides not signing a lease here is to read the 1 star reviews they are all very accurate and telling of what kind of complex this REALLY is, I wish I took the reviews seriously before I signed.My best advice besides not signing a lease here would to be", "This place is so terrible. Literally. Save your money and go somewhere else. Horrible customer service, rude staff and overall worst experience ever. The office lady's have the worst attitudes. They just had a pipe leak and are doing nothing to accommodate their residents nor compensate them.", "I never lived here, but wish i did! I'm over every now and then because my homie lives here. He has a nice set up in the living room and in general. It's pretty fun hanging out here. They give guest parking passes so if you have friends they can be over and don't have to look for parking. I would highly recommend living here if you're a third year at UCR. It's near the UV and not far from school. It's a nice housing community that lends itself well to students. They have a movie room which has a projector, you just gotta rent it out. The pool is nice and big. You also get your own bathroom which is great and the bedrooms are big and come with a desk and chair. Lastly, you don't have to put up with RA's and can basically do whatever you want.", "GM is by far the best apartments to live in near UCR and RCC. I had problems with some of the other apartments around but none here. The workers are friendly and are quick to answer any questions or fix any problem", "Terrible customer service and management skills. So arrogant and rude. Two years here was enough. There's reasons why paying students don't wanna renew here.. bathrooms are dirty, showers rarely work. Dust collects all over the AC vents.... what more??? Problem after problem/ rather pay my money else where", "The best apartments near campus. 15 mins walk away or 5 min bus ride. Been living here for a hear now and wouldn't have chosen anywhere else. So many amenities like, own bedroom, own bathroom, fully furnished and great AC(which is essential in this riverside heat). They're always throwing events for residents at the pool areas, which are super fun and give free food. But the most important quality that Grand Marc has is the free coffee. Let me say that again, an unlimited supply of free coffee. Comes quite in handy during finals week.", "While the office is clean and nice, the noise is insane. I've never had such a loud apartment. At night, people rev their engines and I can hear parties across buildings. Management has done nothing to solve this in spite of multiple complaints. Additionally many of the facilities are in disrepair such as the grills and lounge computers. Don't waste your money and move somewhere else.", "Do not live here. My apartment had so many roaches and I've called so many times about it but they did nothing about it and I continued to get so many bugs. During the move-out process they charged me $20 for an unclean bathroom when the photos they showed me of the bathroom were not even close to a $20 charge. Living here is super expensive and there is way better out there. Don't waste your time.", "Do not live here.

Living here is super expensive and there is way better out there. Don't waste your time.", "Absolutely the worse management. Their whole goal is to steal your money. I lived there for 2 years. When I started living there the room was clean but kitchen was dirty because of the last roommate (they don't even care about the forms you fill out about roommate matching, my roommate was a pothead and dirty guy who didn't wash his dishes for the whole year)  the fridge and stove were extremely dirty and I asked the office repeatedly to clean it. First they said OK but after that they said ask your roommate to clean it because we cleaned it before you come which was a lie because stove and fridge were obviously dirty for a long time. Anyway, the dishwasher also didn't work and after trying to fix it 3 times they gave up and didn't even care. But this is nothing. Before my moving out I cleaned my room spotless and cleaned the whole kitchen and even took pictures and then I got a letter saying I owe $160 because they cleaned a spot on carpet and cleaned the kitchen. I knew they will do something like this because many of my friends had the same experience so I cleaned the carpet too (yes I cleaned my room's carpet)  I have photos and everything too just to prove them wrong. Hopefully the new management is not a scam like campus crossingDo yourself a favor and lease at sterling. It's a bit more expensive but you get more for what you pay like TV and X box  and you don't have to deal with a fraud company. All these reviews don't lie. There's a reason why they get this many bad reviews. I wish I read some reviews before getting trapped by these scammers.", "I lived here from 2016-2017 and it was absolutely awful! Move in day was extremely unorganized because almost all the new people who wanted to move in were trying to get into the office all at once. Once I checked in and got my keys, the moment I walked into my apartment it was disgusting!! There were month old dishes in the sink and there was an odor in the apartment that smelled like death. I opened the fridge and I had no idea what was in the fridge because everything was well past it's expiration date so all the contents in the fridge had weird colors. Lastly, all the bedrooms were filthy and I had to clean my bathroom because it was left filthy. It's not fair that I sign up for a lease and I can't even get a clean apartment on the day of my move in. DONT LIVE HERE. Management is also bias towards their friends so don't expect full support from management when you have issues with your apartment. I absolutely hated living there.", "Best place I've lived so far,Great management, service, short distance from UCR and RCCNo matter what the task is they get it doneAlways love their events and giveaways", "Great place to stay, the management is super friendly, the rooms are super spacious, and it's the closest place to campus! The apartment is pretty big as well unlike UVT where everything is cramped. It's a really great place to stay.", "It's a great apartment near UCR. I can walk to campus, and it will take me around 25 mins.  The apartment is furnished and it's very convenient.", "I had been living here for one year, tried to renew, and then was only notified two weeks before my current lease ends that I had not received a place. When I tried to get any room, they told me that a four bedroom was available. I signed, and turns out that now I am on the wait list with no place to even put my stuff.", "You don't have to worry about being lonely because I was given a free apartmentmate who didn't pay rent and made a mess. Rats don't make great apartmentmates just so you know.", "It's really easy to break into the apt if anyone were to ever try. I broke into my room through the window cus I left my key inside by accident, Even if you were inside the apt, the locks on the individual room doors are also fairly easy to pick.", "It's a really convenient community. With the theater and sorts of restaurants nearby, my roommates and I always have a good weekends afternoon.", "Please DO NOT RENT HERE!!! This place SUX so bad!!! First they re really nice to u, but after u sign the contact, they ll be really really mean n don't even care about ur complain!!! Before u sign the contact, they will show u one of their room but the room is totally different than the one that u r actually living!!! Trust me u will regret for ur rest of ur life if u choose to live there!!! The management and the security sux!!! I hav ta call them everyday ta come fix my door when I first move in!!! It took them a week to actually fix my door!!! I can't even close my door for that one whole week!!! I felt so insecure!!! Trust me all those things re not lies!!! It is my experience in 2010-2011!!!", "pretty good. I love the circumstances here and the staffs are always giving help.Here at Grand Marc, it is very convenient to get to UCR and some restaurants.", "It was nightmare signing the lease. Never told me about I will be on the waiting list until the week of move in day. Make me panic about what if there is no room and school start the next week. The worst part the manager said once I sign the lease, you are bond to the lease term. It will cost me 85% of one month rental if I decide to cancel the waiting list. They just want your money, and not care about your situation.", "nice hardware, shitty roommates arrangement, thanks for putting me with 2 crazy late night party lovers.", "This is my first year living here and it started off pretty bad. I had roaches in my apartment, and my toilet made noises and wouldn't flush correctly. Also, my shower only had cold water, no warm or hot water for a long time until I got it fixed. On top of that, something went wrong when I tried to pay by e-check in January and I got charged a late fee because my payment did not process(I have been using this form of payment since I moved in). Aside from all that, I do enjoy the amenities Grand Marc comes with, including the gym, free printing, the pool, and how they do little events once in a while and feed us. Also, the staff is super nice and they always try to resolve my issues as quickly as possible.", "Pros:  Fully furnished- you never know how great this is until you've lived in an unfurnished place.   15-20 minute walk to campus  Close proximity to dining and theater- great if you don't have a car  Internet, and water included, electricity cap  In unit washer and dryer   Large apartments/rooms  Free parking   Security guardsCons:   Can be noisy, especially the C and F buildings   The student staff members are not very smart or very polite, you have to know what is going on.   Sometimes maintenance is very slow, but I have noticed calling the office merits a faster response.   The gym equipment is always broken  Gates aren't always locked, making it easy for undesirable people to come in   Rent is very high compared to campus apartments  Management doesn't require a background check for renters. Over the past four years grandmarc has had it's ups and downs. I have seen spikes in violence, robberies, fights, rowdy parties and police presences followed by low renter numbers. This past year has seen ample improvement in my opinion, just based on security and current renters. There have been more serious respectful and watchful security that regularly patrol and quickly answer and deal with complaints. The student staff still sucks, none of them have customer service skills. The apartments are nice, and it's nice to live so close to food options and campus, this is much better than the ucr apartments from the perspective of someone who does not have a car, and despite the problems mentioned, I would recommend this complex to a friend.", "Grand Marc at the University Village has been a pretty good experience.  The rooms are furnished, and everyone gets their own bathrooms.  The bedrooms are decently big and there's more than enough space for everything you wold bring to a college apartment.  The mattresses aren't the most comfortable, but after adding a mattress pad, it's not so bad.  There was some minor damage in the apartment like dents and scratches, but overall a good place to live andown fairly priced.", "In fact, I prefer Grandmarc to other student community around UCR. The room I lived is clean and lovely. The safety of Riverside is not good. But Grandmarc's security is at least better than other community.", "Grand Marc apartments are very spacious and come with many convenient amenities. The apartment is completely furnished and comes with a washer and dryer which is great. There is 24 hour security and the management is very helpful! Although the apartment was very dirty when we moved in it is still ok. Requested 3rd or 4th floor and got the 4th which is great!", "DO NOT LIVE HERE!!!!!!!!!! REALLY!!!!!!!!!!       Environment are bad and the manner of officer are not good.     I already lost my packages three times and one of the time they wrote the wrong apt #!!!!         DO NOT LIVE HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Grandmarc has been the best place I have ever lived at through my college experience at UCR. It's close to campus and right across from the University Village. For around $745 a month, you get your own room and bathroom with utilities included. Grandmarc makes maintenance and paying rent extremely convenient through online forms and the front has always been helpful for anything I needed. 10/10 would recommend living here.", "Grandmarc has been my housing for the past year and although there are many problems with it: Parking, Pricing, Gates, Maintenance, and other issues; this place isn't that bad. During my stay here (Fall 09-Spring 10) was not that bad. When i first moved in, i couldn't get water through my showers and they fixed it the day after. I couldn't figure out the internet also, however they couldnt help me with that and that made doing homework and other assignments pretty difficult, however after complaining about 2-3 times they finally managed to fix it. Parking here is extremely difficult, especially if you are trying to have guest come over, you must get a \"guest permit\" which is good for a day and if you forget or do not get it renewed, your car most likely will get towed. They do have a 24/7 fitness center, however in the morning it smells like lysol, and in the late night it smells like sweat. However generally the room is pretty clean and neat.This place isn't that bad however for the cost of living in a house further away would be better since i did pay 795/person for a 4BR/4BA which is relatively pricey considering the same 4BR/4BA house a few blocks away is less than 550 a person. Overall,for the convienence (Walking distance to the school, University Village, and others) i consider grandmarc as a 2.5/5 establishment. However they drastically need improvement.BTW, the girls that work in front are pretty attractive and helpful.", "If you could find anywhere else to live, don't live here!! My first year I thought that it was just an okayy place to live, but it wasn't until I realized how much money they cheat off of you. They offer $100 gift cards if you renew your lease, but there's a catch to it. They raise the prices even though you are renewing it. The rent should stay at least stay the same, not get raised. The worst thing about it is that I found out after the last day to renew your lease, they dropped the prices down. They TRICK you. The couches at grand marc are DISGUSTING. In the model apartment, they obviously show you the nice leather couches that they only have in a few apartments. We were still stuck with ugly couches with holes and rips. Also the water there is disgusting. It is MILKY. I do not know how I survived living there for 1.5 years. The only good thing I can say is that it's a close walking distance to school and that if you were lazy, you could take the trolley to school.Oh and you better have your parking permit or be ready to throw $500 out the window to get your car back from the towing company. I've watched them tow cars within a minute. I've seen people run to their car while their car was being towed, but wasn't allowed to get it back until they went to the towing company. Thank goodness that never happened to me.", "This place is a scam. They advertise themselves to be some kind of luxurious apartment but actually living here says otherwise. The cockroaches are a huge problem for those living on the 1st floor. Security is also a joke here. Just look at the Yelp reviews of this dump and you will see that security is just an illusion to make this place seem safe for students to rent out. The management here is god awful at communication. One employee will say one thing and another will say something entirely different if you bring up the same topic. The only thing this place truly excels at is trying to steal your money. They get 5 stars for that. I personally felt that grandmarc has intentionally gone out of their way to charge you for anything possible. I've been finessed several hundred extra dollars from this place and never felt so scammed in my life. If you don't want your money to be stolen by a joke of a management, don't live here. Please read all the reviews here on yelp and you will see that grandmarc is fake af.", "I would give this place 0 stars if I could. Listen to everyone else and find somewhere else to live!! It's not even that nice. These people are good at their jobs, and that is scamming college students. Even when they make a mistake, it ends up being your fault. In an incident that happened to me, one of the workers told me \"everyone makes mistakes\".... girl. I know that, but that doesn't mean I have to fully suffer the consequences for it. They do not compromise whatsoever and they really don't care about you. It's hard to argue with them because they will say everything is in the contract and more bs. Not to mention they ALWAYS charge so much when you move out to \"replace\" and \"clean\" even when we did clean the place before leaving. How can the place be spotless when some tenants are STILL living there for the next year?! Doesn't make sense if you ask me lol. They even told me that I was going to get refunded the remaining balance I had left in my acc, but when I called to ask them about it again they claimed that it was a \"system error\" BSBSBS!! Get your management together. 10/10 would NOT recommend.", "I love my apartment! I love having my own room and bathroom for the price I'm paying! Definitely a good atmosphere and friendly staff! Will recommend it to my friends!", "This place is without a question the best living situation there is for College students in the Riverside area. The staff is very professional and polite and attend to the residents requests. Re-newing my lease was the easiest decision I've had to make in 2017 so far! God bless the Grand Marc", "I love my apartment! I love having my own room and bathroom for the price I'm paying! Definitely a good atmosphere and friendly staff! Will recommend it to my friends!", "worst Apartment around riverside, all they care about is money, they don't care about ur problems.

If you are a loner type person, who's pretty quiet, it can get boring, so its definitely what you make of it. I live with 6 other girls, in a four bedroom 4 bathroom apartment, and three rooms are doubled up. It's not crowded at all, and with all our different schedules we seem to balance home life well. Then again, these girls are like family so we are pretty comfortable with each other. if you are a one person guy or girl, you can get your own room for about 760, all utilities included, or double up with a random for 460. I double up so i pay 460, for everything included.Included in package- utilities, pool, rec room, internet, basic cable, laundry room inside apartment (SUPER NICE), hang out place, movie theatre, pool tables, outdoor BBQ grills, and basic kitchen appliances. My hall mates and I made it our home and because we loved it so much we signed for next year because if you are a resident your rent becomes 100 dollars less, which is super nice. We bought a TV, put some decorations up, and made it homely.The staff are nice, can be a bit nicer, but overall helpful. Although, when you want something repaired, it can take a while, but they will eventually get to it. Mail comes in and goes out safely, so no problem with that. Theft- not a problem. Don't flaunt your shit and you will be fine. Living on the third floor or fourth is best because it's a lot quieter and less risky- not that its risky. The managers are nice- they work with you if you need help paying or financial services!! Def seek this place out :) GREAT FOR AN AWESOME COLLEGE EXPERIENCE OR FIRST TIME APARTMENT", "I lived at sterling last year and moved to grandmarc this year. When I cleaned before moving out I did it just as I did when moving out of sterling. Grandmarc charged me $124 when Sterling which is a much nicer place to live in charged me nothing. They did not inform me of this when I moved in and it is not specifically stated in my lease. They charged me for paint because apparently thumbprint on walls need to be completely repainted, carpet cleaning when the stains that were there were from previous years, basic cleaning and leaving items behind. They will find any little reason like fingerprints to charge you. Apparently they charge EVERYONE this fee when moving out when it isn't even stated in the lease. Don't live here if you want to have these problems.", "Was given 4th floor when we requested 1st floor. Overall it is close to campus so the location is nice. The rec and pool area are also a plus.", "Despite people warning me not to live here, I was swept away by it's beauty on the outside, and what I thought were extremely nice people who worked here. It was close to Campus, the trolley stop, the UV, and the bus stops. This is more of a transitional place to live when you get out of the dorms because everything is already ready for you, however you will get over it fast.I will start with the good things: a new gym, free printing, washer and dryer inside of the apartments, furnished, free parking, and the maintenance fixes stuff as fast as they can get to it. That is about it.Now the bad:When we first moved in and within the first month we had to get our microwave, dishwasher, and door lock replaced. As i said before, everything appeared so nice, but when you actually move in there were so many flaws. When you move in, even though there was no down payment, they make you pay for the whole month of September, even though you moved in during the last week of it. Rent is already almost double then what you would pay at any other place for a 4bd/4bath.The plumbing and the thin walls. These are the thinnest walls ever as I can hear every room around me taking their showers or doing anything in their bathrooms. It is so loud that it can literally wake you up in the middle of the night. You can hear the people upstairs walking, playing music, and whatever else. The toilets are disgusting and water never seems to be clean. The shower clogs a lot. I would never live here again even if everything else was perfect just because of there reasons.The employees were very nice when they were trying to get us to sign their leases, however it was all just an act. Now when you go into the office most of them are rude and don't even offer to help you. They sit at their desks texting when you are right in front of them waiting to be helped. And when you do get helped, more than half the time they do not know anything that you need to know. The security of the place is awful. There is a gate, but it is usually broken and left open. I see people jump over the fences in the back buildings to come collect cans or whatever else. Mine and my friend's bike has had its stuff and tire stolen off of it. Keep your bike on your balcony or in your room!Also, the jacuzzi never works...Don't let them trick you into living here, I wish I hadn't been.", "My living experience at Grand Marc at University Village (2011-2012) was beyond bad! What made me sign a lease there was how luxurious it looks, e.g. the game room, large pool, little theater, etc. not to mention how nicely put together the demo apartment is, which is not how the \"real\" apartments are like!  On Move-in Day, we found out that we were supposed to live on the first floor, next to an elevator. Often, we would hear people walking and talking coming from all directions! Outside, Upstairs, and even beside us! However, we were looking at the glass half full-not empty-and tried to enjoy the rest of fall quarter (2011), with the exception of noisy residents.Worse still, there were glass bottles being thrown and throw up on the sidewalk, that wasn't even cleaned up until later. Also, I once saw a car's rear window completely shattered, so I reported it to the main office, but they did nothing. On Winter break, we all went back to our hometowns, so our apartment was empty of people. However, when my roommate and I decided to extend our lease, we dropped by our apartment and found it to be empty of our valuables! Both of my TVs and my Xbox 360 (plus Kinect), and my roommate's WiFi modem were all stolen! We immediately told the office, but they did not feel sorry or were apathetic at all! In fact, they had the audacity to call and ask about our thoughts of renewing our lease in less than a month later! Unfortunately, we are stuck at Grand Marc for another 8 months! Long story short:  If you want to watch your back 24/7, this is the place to live! If you want to get robbed, this is the place to live! If you have money to buy nice, expensive things, get it stolen and replace it, this is the place to live! if you like installing safety alarms and window locks, this is the place to live! If you have trouble sleeping at night, then this is the place to live! You might as well put a welcome mat on the floor and leave your door open!", "ZERO STARS! !!!!!! First of all unless you're a UCR student, good luck getting any maintenance help, not to mention the apartments looked like the city dump when i moved in. Broken furniture and appliances. The employees at the Grand Marc are very rude, and not helpful at all. Just a bunch of student workers who have no idea what they're doing. I was involved in a \"hit and run\" incident here at the GM, my car was hit in the parking lot. I filed out all the necessary documents including police reports. I've been waiting almost a month now to talk to someone in charge here. All I ever hear is \"they're busy, \"they cant talk right now\", \"come back another day\" So i do, and I get the same response. So today I went in again, when I was told the manager wouldn't be able to talk to me, again, I got the same excuses. So, my boyfriend who is fed up at this point, walks into her office (which was open), only to ask to speak with her, since we had no cooperation from the employees at the front desk (as usual). She told us to get out because \"he scared her\". Funny thing was, she was sooooo busy, on FACE BOOK... Seriously, FUCK THIS PLACE. id rather be homeless then have to deal with such disrespect. I pay rent, I deserve what I pay for. the Grand Marc is a disgrace to student housing, its filthy, and unprofessional. Cynthia Arroyo should not be working at the Grand Marc with such a high position of authority, she doesn't care about the residents, and she is very rude.", "If you are a student that is looking for a place to stay close to UCR campus, PLEASE STAY AWAY AND DON'T EVEN TRY CONSIDERING THIS PLACE! I stayed in Grand Marc with 3 other friends in the 2011-2012 school year and to say choosing this place was a mistake is an understatement. They have the worst management ever and they lie to all their tenants. In our last month or 2 of staying there, we were having major leaks in our living room ceiling and in my roommates' room. They didn't fix it for WEEKS. Not only that, they charge you after you move out, even when you clean everything spotless and make it look cleaner than when you had moved in!! Plus, the rent for such a crappy place is super expensive. I had shared a room with another girl and it cost us $510/month. And that's $510 EACH, not altogether. Also, the gate is always broken, even when they try to fix it. The gym has NO A/C and there are always random families that don't live in Grand Marc that swim in the pool. Our A/C was funky and not working as well in the spring/towards the summer, and seeing as we lived on the 4th floor, and it being Riverside, it was wayyy too hot. Not to mention, there were quite a few shootings in our building. Yeah, talk about safe.The only positive thing I have to say is that the apartment is furnished, parking is free, and having permits for guests was nice since it lasted the whole day/night. And maintenance was nice, although they were late to fix our leaks.If I could give this place zero stars, I definitely would because it deserves it.", "a horrible place to leave. Grandmarc does not care about tenants and management always try to find a way to steal your money out of your pocket. There is no security at Grandmarc. Last night people broke my car front window and the only thing I heard from management was \"contact your insurance, we are not responsible\".If you leave your key at home and ask management to open your apartment door they charge you$25.  When you sign the contract utility is included in your rent, but as soon as you move, they charge you for utility. I'm not going to renew my lease and also I'm not recommend anyone to live in Grandmarc.", "I wish I could give them no star what so ever. Because this place doesn't deserve any sort of good comments period.  Let me warn you all about this place. If you are international students avoid this place or kiss your down pay good bye you are not going to get it back. They will make stupid excuses to hold your down pay once you move out. I rented out one room for my wife at this place. The day that walked in to the apartment, the place was literally TRASH. Boxes everywhere, there was more rotten food in the refrigerator than the garbage box. Called one of the employees to complain he gave us some stupid excuse and walked off. Before checking out we cleaned  everything. Now that my wife has checked out they have sent us a bill for damages.  In the end all I can say to the readers is this management is bunch of crooks and place is a trash hole Avoid it and good luck.P.S. Please believe if they say it's a new management. They told us that B.S too. There is a white guy and Iranain girl working at this place for past 2 years and you will still find them. Really all the students/residents should sue the owner/management of this place", "Grand Marc really shows the bad side of greed and capitalism. The only people who really should stay here are spoil kids who get stay where ever they want because there Trust Fund is paying for there school, or that go to that useless Art Academy that has dorms here. Here are just a few bullet points to show why its better to stay at the Motel 6 across the street from the palms than here- Grand Marc is the Comcast of apartments, meaning even though they have vacancies (go look in the back), they will not cut you a better rate if you ask. I assume they think that all college students are stupid and don't know how to negotiate rates. - If I wanted to murder someone (which I don't), steal a car or be up to no good, I would go to Grand Marc. Why? Security is a joke and if parents knew about the serious security problems of Grand Marc, they would never put there Trust Fund children here. I have seen fights, gun shots, vandalism, theft and a wide variety of vice activity. I understand Riverhood isn't always that safe and yes, stuff does happen, but I do not see any effort by management to improve the security situation. There is never any fallow ups done on security and nothing is ever taken seriously. Its a running joke in UCR that s%$t goes down in either Grand Marc or the Mediterranean Cafe. Now the Mediterranean Cafe closed, Grand Marc now has a monopoly on crime. When there are complaints of noise, nothing is ever done.-The facilities are really run down. Don't let the pictures on there website trick you. The computers in the \"business center\" has so much spam and malware, I don't even feel safe watching porn there. The gym always smells like my socks after a 16 mile hike and it is similar to what you find at a Econo Lodge gym, only nothing works. - Rent prices does not make sense. Anyone who actually signs a contract here and please yelp, don't get mad at me, is a spoiled kid relying on daddy to pay rent, or someone who has no money sense. Why the Hell would you spend over $800 for a single room, shared by 3 other people in the Inland Empire???? Sure, it can make sense in San Francisco or New York, but not Riverside. Every time someone signs a 12 month contract for Grand Marc, someone should call the police as they just got raped out of there own money. If you really consider your other housing options in the area, like living in a non-student focused apartments, rented a home or ever commuted, you would know you will be getting a horrible deal.- Do you like riding your bike? Well so does the person who will steal it and cut your chain. Again, goes back to the lax of security. - You are stuck in a 12 month lease. Graduating in June or not taking Summer Classes, tough shit for you. Either sublease the place or brake your contract. Every May/June around campus, I see countless of adverts of some yobo trying to find a sublet. This goes back to common sense people, read your contract. You just pissed away 2 months rent because you didn't consider you might graduate 2 months before your lease is up.- Internet is a must have while in college. Either studying for your next final or looking at inappropriate things on Reddit, all college students need internet. They say it is included in your rent but they don't tell you it is very, very slow.All in all, nothing makes sense. When doing a review on Yelp, I really like to give the business the benefit of the doubt or a chance to improve, all this company does is rape thousands of dollars of college students financial aid and gives them a bad deal. Is what they do legal? Yes, but they can easily take advantage of college students who do not stand up or defend there rights.", "June '11 - June '12Most of these reviews here are very negative, and most would think that the reviews are extremely biased when more than half of the reviews here are 1 star ratings. There are many reasons why.Convenience:    First of all, it's about $800 for a single in a 4 room apartment. There are activation and deactivation fees for your utilities as well. All fees and rent can be paid for online. The good thing about utilities is that you will almost never go over your $30 allowance. The best part about the utilities is the fact that anything outside your room does not count towards your utility bill. The washing machine and dryer are a nice bonus if you stay for the weekends. Also, Grand Marc is located pretty close to campus and University Village. 7-11, Ranch 1, Yoshinoya, Denny's, Shakey's, and Starbucks are right next to you. It's about a 15-30 minute walk from GM to campus, 5 minute bike ride, and 10 minutes to skate.-3/5- Security:    Apparently, all you need to open the door is to slip an ID card into the door crack and if you wiggle it around the right way, you'll get the door open. Luckily, I didn't had any break-ins. The apartments that faces Iowa Avenue are the WORST. The loudest of the loud live there, and there are parties that go on weekly in multiple apartments, but the other buildings are OK. Windows are noise proof, but when you do open it, the noise of the freeway fills up the room. Sirens from firetrucks and police go off at least once a week.     The front gate where you use the key card to walk through almost never works. This means that ANYONE can walk in. I've seen homeless people and a man and his wife come in to pick up recyclables in the trash cans, and fishing them out from first floor balconies. Also, the gate for cars is just as reliable. It's always open, and it'll be \"fixed\" for a week or two, but it'll be broken again for another 4 months. Here's what I don't get: why lock the walk-in gate while keeping the car gate open? That means whoever wants to walk in can walk in! Security guards just stand around to make it look like they're doing their job. There are three security guards that are on duty at night; two of them stand and talk at the gate while the third patrols while on the phone (with his lady friend, I assume). Even with the patrol, I had my handlebars and seat stolen. I made the mistake of locking my bike outside for one night, but thank god I invested in a u-lock. I woke up to a damaged u-lock. Someone obviously tried cutting it, but that didn't work. Then, after that person realized what a fool he is, he steals my handlebars and my seat. My seat was a very nice Specialized one (no quick release), and my handlebars were missing. I'm just lucky the guy didn't cut my brake cables.-1/5-Cleanliness:     The first thing I noticed was how filthy the apartment was. This is not Grand Marc's fault, but I assumed that it would at least be clean if maintenance comes in to inspect the apartment. Throughout the year, people just toss beer bottles and cigarette butts all over the place. Over the balcony, walkways, you name it. No one cleans it. I also found roaches in my dishwasher. Pool is usually dirty as well. Dead bees and leaves there. Gym is stuffy, with 2/3 treadmills broken. I have never seen staff come in to wipe and clean machines either.-1/5-Staff:    The summer I was there, I cleaned up the shithole. I leave the apartment at the end of summer session 2, leaving the place spotless. Then some idiot who went home for the summer moves in. He leaves all his stuff in the living room. His clothes and trash littered all over the living room, dinner table filled with empty pizza boxes and pasta trays. Then, the staff has the nerve to call me to tell me that I had made a mess and that I would be fined $50 for each bag of trash they get. I flip because I live 50 miles away and I question them. They say they inspected the apartment and it's a mess and that I was responsible. I drove there, to find that the trash was from the guy who was about to move in. Things were resolved at the end, but I got accused by the staff.     Maintenance is also quick to reply. They tell you they received your email, but here's the kicker; they don't fix anything on the first visit, and then come back a week later to actually do what you asked them to!-1/5-Personally, I would not recommend anyone to live here. It's not worth the money, nor the trouble. There are so many better apartments and houses that you can find around the area for almost the same price. Split a house with friends for ~$500 a room, buy a parking permit ( $300 a quarter; $100 a month and allow $100 a month for gas ). That would be at most around $750. It is better than other apartments in the area (Palms, UCR apartments), but it has a very shady community and mediocre staff. I doubted the Yelp reviews, and tried it out for myself.The 1 star reviews are EXTREMELY ACCURATE. Live at your own risk.", "Was looking for places to live for next year (fall 2018), with 3 other guys. We looked at Sterling, UV Towers, and here. It was a great tour and I really enjoyed the facilities, however the rent was about $100 more than UV, and they also have a utility cap where you pay the difference if you go over. I was looking for something that was absolutely all inclusive, so I chose UV. That wasn't even the problem though. Grand Marc called me and asked if I was still interested. When I said no and that I chose somewhere else, I was asked where and why I chose them. I told them UV Towers because everything is included and the leasing agent says \"Well they have a utility cap too but okay\" and hangs up. Actually Grand Marc, they do not. I asked upon application and it is also listed on their website that UV Towers has no utility cap. I did not appreciate the rude and ignorant statement, and this confirmed my decision to stay with the UV Towers.", "i lived here for three years. three years of torturous hell. the first year my apt was broken into 4 times. nothing was stolen but they got into everyone's room and turned it upside down. when we told the management if they had anything on tape, they said that the security cam was facing the top floors to see if anyone was throwing trash over their balcony. yeah, bc trash being thrown over the balcony is more important than the first floor being broken into numerous times. so the second year they promised my roommates and i an upper floor apt with no additional cost (bc back in 2004-2005 they charged more the higher up you wanted to live). it was all good except they must've put us into the \"ghetto loud people live in this building\" building. there were non-stop partying and one weekend there were gun shots in the parking lot. not to mention someone banged my car in while it was parked in the parking lot.third year (in 2007-2008) i didnt have many problems, except one weekend i had two girlfriends of mine sleep over. at about 3am we heard several gunshots and looked outside to see a whole slew of people running around and screaming. someone was shot and the next day we saw a trail of blood near building D.although they have security it doesnt do shit for the safety of the residents there. the security obviously is incompetent and lets in whoever they want, even people with weapons.i dont recommend this apt and dont get suckered into staying here like i did.", "Do not live here! The management is terrible, the security is terrible, the people that live here are terrible, and most of all the price to live here is absolutely terrible. I've lived here for two years, and this last year has been the absolute worst. My car was vandalized twice in the past year in the \"gated\" so-called safe parking lot. Management did not help at all. The people that live here are have no respect for other's belongings either. People throw cigarette butts and beer bottles off their balconies at other cars all the time these past 2 years. Grand Marc is the worst.", "It's not bad, per say. Not the greatest though. Rent's the cheapest for a double, all other places make you pay extra for 10 month contracts. For a private room, it's better to go elsewhere. The filth is probably the worst part. Everything is fine except for the filth.+ Management, price, facilities, apartment amenities and inside cleanliness, location: all satisfactory.- Very dirty outside the apartments, prepare to get your car scratched, need to buy your own router (it's like this for most places though), security is weak and the walls are thin. Roaches are a problem but since it's a health code violation, you can get it fixed quickly. Water's bad, you need a filter if you want to drink it.Tips: 1. Always buy the 10 month lease if they don't charge more for doing that. You can always extend the lease but you can never lower it.2. You need a water filter.3. You should leave 30 minutes in advance if you are walking to UCR.4. Pray to something that you don't get bad roommates. This is true for everywhere though.tl;dr It's ok, could be better, but it's ok.", "This is my second year living at grand Marc, my experience has been decent and I love how close to campus and the UV village these apartments are. I don't really like the rent, it's a bit expensive for me, but I love the fact that I have my own room so I can't complain too much. Besides the rent, everything else is great! The staff is friendly and super helpful, and the apartments are cozy and are literally your home away from home.", "honestly worst place to ever live. Therenew management sucks and they think they are better than any other apartment complex. Well news flash for you Grandmarc, your utilities are awful and your overall service is garbage. I will definitely will not be living here next year.  I'd rather live in a box then this dump.", "Grand Marc is a really nice residence where we can do lots of things.  We can watch a movie at the movie theater or get tanned thanks to the tanning beds. The swimming pool is also amazing !", "A wonderful experience so far - some of the utilities in the room needed to be fixed and were a bit dirty, but that's to be expected sometimes. Staff, amenities and especially the internet have all been fantastic!", "So far my experience living here has been decent. The carpets were really dirty and the toilet makes weird noises every time I flush, but other than a couple minor things, living here hasn't been so bad.", "So far it's ok. Staff are friendly, met one roommate so far and she was nice, and love the size of my room. However, when I did move in I noticed that the kitchen cabinets are old and are in need of replacement. Also one of the smoke detectors were missing and only the wires showed. Another thing is that it appears that they switched a light cover and forgot to take the old light cover with them. Although, the community so far is great and hopefully I get to meet my other two roommates soon.", "When I went to UCR, I stayed here for 3 years. Not sure why I did but there are its perks. The problem is really with the management and the parking situation never got resolved. Can you really expext a college apartment for college students only to not have any friends over? What planet did you come from? Towing college students kids' cars is just plain mean. When I stayed there, the only really great perk was the individual rooms with individual bathrooms and unlimited utilities (which Riverside gets REALLY hot). Walls are super thin which you would think they would take into some consideration that some kids will be loud while others will be studying. They hire other college kids to work the front desk and they seem completely chaotic. Management had some serious issues and took advantage of kids until the parents stepped in.", "this is applying to SUMMER only so if you can get someones lease for cheap, which you can most likely do since everyone is trying to get out of their one year leaseexceptionally quite over the summer, not a lot of people in general are living in the grand marc during the summer which means easier to get closer parking spots to your unit.for some reason i don't hear sirens every day, kind of weird.  Also i keep my place at 75 which is nice and cold when the outside weather is 90+", "WARNING TO ALL UCR STUDENTS, if you want a quiet place to study and live peacefully this isn't it.1. you will hear sirens EVERY single day.2. academy of art students stay here and all they do is party* or go into the business room and hit up facebook or MYSPACE, yes i said myspace. and all they seem to do is party, or go aound in their car helka blastin music hella loud. oh and crowd the gates at night......3. people in the leasing office are genuinely nice, but from what i've experienced do not know how to deal with angered customers.once you signed that lease you stuck for that year. unless you can find someone to replace you", "Living here has had ups and downs. Stared off the year with new carpet installer in my room which was nice but about a month ago, our unit was infested with fleas resuting in all of us(roomates) being covered by these bites. Management is also fine with the exception of a single person in the front office whos name starts with an S (do not want to name). When I walked in the front office to pick up my package, they said they do not have it when clearly on my amazon it was signed an hour ago by the same girl. I got back to my room, called to ask when they would be done for this is a really important package and she responds with \"the front office is really busy so we don't know when we will be able to get to that\". The part that furiates me is that when I was in the office 3 minutes ago, the staff were all sitting around chatting while the front office was literally just the staff members.", "So far everything is good! Sometimes the gate doesn't work but they usually fix it quickly. They also get to the work orders quickly as well.", "The grandmarc is the worst ppartment i lived. especially for the service from staff. they are careless about anything but money.  and it is super noisy on night.", "this is my third year living at grandmarc, and overall its been a good experience. I feel like I know this property better than most, and I have seen all the ups and downs. There have been staff changes both good and bad. For a period of time there was a manager who was practically out of reach to residents and she didn't care too much about our opinions. She was recently replaced and I really see a good effort to get the place back to top form. I personally like the close distance to UCR. It's not right across the street or anything, but it's not a bad little walk, and I usually make it two to three times a day while school is in session.The new manager is a lot more open to speaking with residents and resolving any issues, and he hired a new security company that is doing a much better job than the last one.When I came here in 2010 my rent was $725 for a private in a four bedroom, and it went up to $739 the first time I renewed. I currently pay $699 after renewing my lease yet again, and next year i'll only be paying $640! Maybe the lowering rates are because the only people who like to review the place are people who are upset.I have made a lot of friends living here the past couple years and I look forward to making more. It's very convenient having everything so close too. University Village is right across the street and the 7-11 there comes in quite handy. Also, theres a lot of places to eat all over the place surrounding the complex, and there is a kmart and stater bros down the street as well. I have a car, but for people who don't you probably wouldn't need one. There are two bus stops very close too, one across the street, and another around the corner, so you can get wherever you need to go using RTA if you need to.The gym is what it is.. an apartment complex gym. It gets the job done and its convenient, but there are stupid people who brake things from time to time. I found over the years, that instead of getting pissed at the staff over minor things and letting them build up until you condemn the place with a 1 star review, just go to them politely and tell them whats going on that is upsetting you and they will be a lot more helpful in trying to get things resolved. Now that the mean lady isn't running the place and stressing out her employees, the staff seems a lot more laid back and helpful.I have personally never had any issues with receiving packages or anything, but I am always careful to double check to make sure i put my apt number on it. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt, and not just throw out blame. I think you make your experience however you want to make it. If you are a positive person, you will have a positive experience. If you are a negative person you will have a negative experience. Unfortunately for GM, only negative people seem to take the time to write reviews.", "I have lived at Grandmarc for the last year. I can honestly say there is nothing I could bring up that would put down this establishment. Management and maintenence are really nice and do their best to fix anything. Security is there and I haven't heard of any rooms getting broken into. Personally I find the price is reasonable because each bedroom includes a full bathroom. Rent also includes cable, internet, and utilities which I like because I can take hot showers and bump the air conditioning whenever the weather is unbearable. People have really high expectations and complain when they could make the most of their experience. I applaud the staff for putting up with all the hate for the past few years and doing their best to meet the needs for future residents. I have seen them replace furniture in the game room and study room as well as wax the floors of every apartment and change the carpet if it is needed. Also, I appreciate that they give out food to the residents twice every month. There's a reason that I signed another lease for this coming year and I would recommend any college student to give Grand Marc an open chance.", "DON'T LIVE HERE!Don't be fooled by the model rooms. The real rooms are completely different. The apartment's walls are super thin. The rooms are easily broken into and there are fights outside in the parking lots.The internet is iffy. It turns off at random and it is really slow.There is also a fee you will have to pay for utilities on the first month. Mine ended up being $60/person", "Honestly, I read some of these reviews and did not believe what they said. Don't live here..Most of the staff are rude, unhelpful, contradict themselves, or give you false information. I had so many experiences with them already.Printing is free but 8/9 the printers doesn't work...it is expensive and there is still hidden fees..there was a good dark skin security that actually did his job in regulating the area...now I do not see any of the securities except friday nights..I seen homeless people get in and noone sees...the gym sucksthe apartments are filthy they are nothing like the ones you see in the tour..and you can't even argue against hidden fees because the application was so perfectly written and after you sign you are screwed...i will never live here again and don't recommend it to anyone...take is from the person who went against all odds..have a nice day....look for on campus apartments they are cheaper!!!", "This place is the worst pace to live, ever. The management is unprofessional and there is so many of them that actual efficient communication is impossible. The manager is rude at times too. I had to deal with not only my dishwasher not working the entire time I was there (they did not fix it until the week I moved out) but also bedbugs and a peeping tom that they never got back to me on. They did not even go in to fix my blinds so the issue will not happen again (my blinds were not properly set up so about and inch and a half of window was uncovered which the peeper was able to watch me). I also had to kill a mouse that was in the apartment when I moved in BY MYSELF! The reason being is that the exterminator would come in and just keep laying sticky traps which did not work in the first place. As for the bed bugs the people had to treat twice and they gave us a little paper saying throw away old beds which they did not do. They said they \"treated\" their beds. If this happens to you insist on getting a NEW BED! that is the issue with furnished apartment you do not know who was in their before you.  The lease is even a joke and beware they will milk you for all your worth so find somewhere else that is a nice apartment that will not eat up your money and you will get what you paid for. As for rent in the beginning they expect you to pay a full months rent when you do not get to move in until later in the month when school starts, they do not take into consideration that other schools start earlier. Students and parents beware if something seems to good to be true it is! Yes the amenities are included but you are better off living somewhere else for cheaper and splitting some utilities which is not that expensive and it can establish credit which we as students need to do anyway... Avoid this place like the plague!", "Haven't moved in yet but scheduled to do so on sept 22 they don't pro rate and are asking for a 770 for the month of September. Make sure to read your lease. They will scan you will update when I get there.", "grandmarc is awesome!!yes you pay alot but youve got parking included when elsewhere it may be up to $150 for a few months, bills are included, where some where else youd have to pay about $200. theres a gym that  other apts dont offer, it may be busy at times but so is the rec center at ucr. youve got free printing and internet access which is rare (ucr only gives u 40 max while grandmarc offers unlimited for residents). the complex is gated and security is present  every night although adding more than one woud make it much better. Parties, they happen from time to time, not always mexican music bumping from the maintenance workers because only one lives here and he lives with his family and parties are found everywhere: college dormitories, campus apts, and any other off campus apts. you pay what you get. the keystones may not be too helpful sometimes but thats bc theyre student workers not proffesional apt managers. homeless come in to get cans and bottles from the trash bins during the day and early evening but then again they are everywhere; on campus, around falkirk, windwood, copper cayon, canyon crest, glenmore, bannockburn, stondehaven, sterling, around residential areas, its East Riverside for crying out loud! thats all there is in this part of town! the maintenance guys may be a little slow sometimes but theyve got more than 250 apts to attend to, from lockouts to bad furniture to clogged sinks etc but these problems also occur elsewhere, even at home! living at grandmarc is a great experience and its right for the price; oh yeah, remember that it comes with a refrigerator, dishwasher, stove, microwave, bed, sofa, couch, dining table, dresser, dryer, tv stand and access to gym, computer lab, parking by permit only( so only residents can park and avoid all the trouble of other complexes who dont seem to have enough for their residents) a pool and a balcony!!!", "Gran Marc is beautiful and really well kept. I love the security, but the leasing office is lacking in helpfulness. All in all, moving here has been pleasant.", "All I can say is that Grand Marc is the sh*ttiest place ever. It's not worth living here because the management don't care at all. All they want to do is get your money. The gate is always broken. The speed bump for the car gate is annoying as hell. The \"fitness\" center is small with absolutely nothing inside. I would have to say that the internet is really really slow. During the night time, it would lagg and disconnect. To me, the internet is a MUST!!! And there were times when the internet was out for a whole week. I've lived here for 2 years and I haven't seen any improvement except for an increasing in rent. Rent is absolutely ridiculous. With the price I'm paying... I can find better places with an affordable price. They always have these events but its always a low turnout because its so plain. The kitchen smoke alarm is retard sometimes when you are baking cookies(^^) or cooking because it would sound off. The pool seems clean but not really. The bottom of the pool is dirty. Overall, I did not enjoy the overprice rent and the issues that they never resolved.", "I would not recommend living here at all.  Some people actually like it here because they probably got lucky and live in the nicer buildings.  But you don't even get to choose what building you stay in.  Supposedly, the earlier you sign up, the higher your chance of getting the building you want, but that's not true at all.  I didn't even get any of the choices of buildings that I picked.  But that's not all that's bad.  It's really expensive to live here for such crappy apartments, their gate is always broken (although I guess they \"try\" to fix it often) so random people just go in...I've even seen taxi cabs in there searching for people to pick up, the place is always full of trash everywhere, and not to mention, some of their staff members don't TRY to pretend to even give a crap about you.  I feel like the only thing good about this place are the maintenance people, at least they smile and say hi to you all the time.", "I actually really like Grand Marc. I lived in the dorms my freshman year so sophomore year I thought I'd have the same good time but boy was I wrong. Grand Marc is way better than the campus apartments UCR has to offer especially Stonehaven. Ohh my God. Grand Marc is the cheapest off campus apartments available right now. My roommates and I actually just renewed. I feel like if someone doesn't like Grand Marc it's because of old management. The new management now is just great. Jose and David had made the place really turn around because before it wasn't all that great. Something I really like is that they tow cars without permits. Why am I gonna pay for rent and not have a parking space available for me? If you don't have a guest permit it isn't a big deal because you could just park across the street. It's literally a 3 minute walk back to the property. The rooms are a great size also with your own bathroom. All in all, I definitely recommend this place if you're on a budget but don't want to settle for less. I gave it 4 stars because I don't think there is a \"perfect\" apartment out there unless you're just rolling in money.", "The management is definitely improving and they're fixing a lot of things at Grand Marc.

The machines in the gym don't work, the printer never has ink, the computers are so slow the list can go on forever. $800 dollar a  room is a complete rip off. The paint peels, the desk is broken. Just BS in general. The front desk people are worthless. They'll bend over backwards to get you to sign a lease but when you come up to them with a problem they won't even look up from their phone to help. \"There's nothing I can do about it you have to talk to a manager\" is a reflex for them. Also, according to them there never is a manager. STAY AWAY!!!!", "I lived in 3 different apartments throughout my time at UCR and Grand marc is by far the best one. The office staff is really nice and always willing to help. They always give out free food, and lets face it, when you're a broke college student, who doesn't like free food? When I moved in, my room was clean and ready to be lived in. I loved that I did not have to bring any furniture and if I didn't want something that was supplied in my room, the maintenance staff was able to take it out. Maintenance was always very efficient and finished my work orders within a reasonable amount of time. At the beginning of the year, security wasn't that great, but the office realized and made an active effort to replace them with security that is now way better than the previous company.

The apartments are ugly, every year they just paint the walls and bathroom white, which may look clean, but its just covering up years and years of nasty stuff. The kitchen is so old and never cleaned properly. But thats not the worst part. The most horrible thing is their management. Every year they change management, they promise things that they can't keep. Example, they offered $100 for anyone who signs a lease and says that you referred them. It took them a year to have the money available, then they said they didn't have enough gift cards so I could only have what they have left. Same thing has happened to so many people. When you call to have something fixed, they take weeks. Its just a bad place to stay. Unfortunately in Riverside there aren't many nice places to stay, so if you stay here just make sure you get everything they promise in writing and signed.

It is right smack in the middle of where all the homeless hang around. And I had an incident where someone almost broke into my apartment. This building's security isn't great at all, they barely have any cameras, anyone can get through the entrance gate because residents pretty much let anyone in without question and staff will leave it open when cleaning, and the fire escape is able to be opened from the outside. They say they have security check the halls every night but I have not seen them once since living here. I only realized these safety hazards after the incident so if you are planning on moving in just be aware if that and most definitely install a ring camera. Otherwise this place is a good starter place, just be cautious and set up necessary precautions.", "WHATEVER YOU DO, EXIT OUT THIS TAB AND MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE !!!!!When I first moved into this apartment building (Oct 2022) the leasing manager (DANA) was completely accommodating. I wanted a bigger bed. She got me a bigger bed. I wanted a new chair, she sent someone up with a new chair. I felt so accommodated that I even got her See's Candy Chocolates to show my appreciation for her hospitality. As I was moving in, my new roomies informed me of the \"mouse problem\" (as they put it). I went down to the leasing office and DANA supplied our apartment with mouse traps/sticky traps. Although our kitchen was lined with mouse traps, nothing was ever caught or found dead. This set up went on from October 2022- April 2023. Around the end of April, I found a dead mouse on one of the sticky traps in the kitchen. Upon further investigation, the pest control services supplied by the building told me that they were not mice, but in fact roof rats. Later, the pest services found multiple cockroaches (dead and alive) with laid eggs behind our fridge. After pulling the entire fridge unit out, there was a LARGE hole found behind the fridge (so large the pest services even stuck his whole hand in the hole). The next available time I had in my schedule then was purely dedicated to speaking with leasing manager and getting this figured out before my roomies and myself catch any dangerous diseases (especially since all the dead animals were found in the kitchen). Also want to add, the reason I did not jump to write in to maintenance on their \"resident portal\" about the pests was because I have written in in the past and nothing was done about it. Not even a follow up email. (this is why i wanted to go in person to talk to a human not a computer).I approached the leasing manager in a calm but concerned tone as at that moment I just learned about the cockroach eggs and was completely disturbed. I was also a little \"shakey\" because honestly i was nervous to have to bring up an issue like this. it's uncomfortable but i was completely fine. Right when I entered her office, she gaslit me saying \"you seem really shakey, do you want to come back later when you've calmed down.\" my mouth was on the FLOOR. i was so taken back right away. yes i was nervous but she commented on my \"nervousness\" and \"shakiness\" MULTIPLE times saying that I should come back later when i've calmed down. At that moment, i felt so blown back, especially since i was excepting a nice conversation that ended with actual solutions rather than a pure panic attack and crying phone call to my mother because I swear i was on Ashton Kutcher's \"Punk'D.\" The overall way she handled this situation was the worst demonstration of customer service I've experienced. Especially seeing that your client is a little shakey and distraught, all she had to say was \"let's get this figured out, i'm so sorry\". instead , i got interrogated with questions on why i did not put in a maintenance request. it was like the conversation of dead roof rat and laid cockroach eggs went in one ear and out the other. the only thing she was focused on was the fact that there was no maintenance request. at this point, fix the issue. i came to you personally because you didn't respond to my last maintenance request back in October 2022, the least you could do is acknowledge the terribleness of this situation and how you made it 10x worse because of the way you handled it. Never stay here. The only person here that deserves a raise is the nice cleaner lady that says \"hola\" to me every time i walk by. She's a queen and the only person i will miss.BTW. now the leasing office is trying to get over $230 from me for \"room damages.\" this is not true. thank the lord i took pictures of everything.", "I love this place !!!!! It has a cool gym, the students are friendly here !!!!! The best part of this place is Dana !! She is one awesome manager !!!! Not only that, she is  super attractive !!! I would love to go on a date with her !!!!!! She makes University Village Towers glow !!!!!  Rest of the staff is cool too !!!!!  I'm glad I moved in here !!!!!  Awesome place !!!!!!", "My sister currently resides here and her experience here has so far been terrible. When ordering things online, the front desks/lobby people are supposed to hand it to you right? Well they never did and this has happened more than 3 times. Everytime the Amazon driver puts deliver the people in the front desk always says they don't have her package.", "I'm a rising Junior attending UCR. The university apartments were pretty bad, so i decided to look into different apartment complexes around the area. Fortunately, I came across one of the employees by the name of Maria! She answered all my questions regarding the move-in process, the application process, and any other questions I might've had. Am proud to say i am moving in this september! Thank you Maria!", "I lived here for three years and I have seen improvements since I moved in but the facilities and rooms felt old. They renovated some apartments but didn't renovate others. The dishwashers barely worked and sink was extremely shallow and annoying to wash dishes in. No tv for the furnished place. Utilizes were included and it was mostly furnished except for a tv.Pros: has amenities, some apartments are more renovated so you'll be lucky if you get one of those, close to Ucr and university village with a lot of restaurants and movie theatre Cons: amenities are too old", "I come from a low-income household with 3 families living under 1 tiny roof in COMPTON, CA. I made my way to UC Riverside and hit the ground running at an opportunity to start a new life. I thought I could only go up from where I began so I chose University Village Towers without reading the reviews first. Damn was that a mistake.I'D RATHER GO BACK TO THE GHETTO THAN LIVE IN THIS SHIT HOLE. THE MANAGEMENT ARE DISRESPECTFUL, MONEY-HUNGRY CROOKS! LOOK ELSEWHERE AND YOU'll SAVE MORE MONEY WITHOUT ANY STRESS. There's cockroaches everywhere, none of the appliances work, and I think I developed mild asthma from living next to the freeway for a full year.", "Maria at UVT is so helpful! I came to visit and she helped me with any questions I had and was so welcoming! Extremely professional and makes you feel comfortable! Keep it up!", "Okay, I don't write Yelp reviews or try to ever harm businesses but my experience was so awful at this place I had to share, so hopefully future students and young women don't fall victim to this place. When I signed up for a 1 year lease in a 4x4 complex, I did not expect to have many extra roommates that were disgusting and lived in the rent feee.  And let me make it clear, that by extra roommates, I mean roaches and rats. I lived in a HORRIBLY infested unit, and over the course of months I reached out several occasions, via phone and 4 more times being written, and was brushed aside and ignored. They have exterminators come and spray, but it's very light & meant for small cases. The roach issue in my unit was disgusting and much more severe- they were everywhere, all hours of the day, even inside the REFRIGERATOR. I had to throw out many electrical appliances because of the fact that they nested inside of them (you will see an image attached of an air purifier). The staff here failed to acknowledge the problem & ignored my complaints of how serious the issue was. After months of reaching out & not even being able to store food or cook in my own apartment, I asked my dad to get involved. He called, and they finally took the issue seriously, . That next day, they broke my lease early, probably because they realized they had a potential lawsuit for ignoring how uninhabitable this place was. If this doesn't show that they don't listen to their tenants I don't know what will. On top of that, this place is incredibly unsafe. Homeless roam freely & the gate was broken for 2 months. As a young woman I was followed and harassed several times. When I contacted the company about this I was told that if I was so worried about safety I should \"participate in riverside's local city council meetings and voice my concerns\". It's simply not safe & they don't care. I felt like I was going to get kidnapped all the time. I had experiences of people shining flashlights in my window at night trying to see what they could steal as well. I'm sorry this is so long, and theres just so much more I could say, but I'll allow my words and the images attached below to be my proof. Please, especially to my young ladies out there, don't live here.", "Lets see.. I lived here for 2 yrs in a 4x4. Amenties are old, dishwasher leaked and fridge is definitely not enough for 4 people. I never even tried to mop but they do not clean as they say after tenants move. You have to pay for each load of laundry and some days the machines were turned off with no notice so you would have to head to another floor and hope they're on. There was a roach infestation for about half the time I was there, pest control was responsive and just sprayed certain spots but still gross. There was a point in the summer that maintenance would just come in unannounced and scare the shit outta me. I resorted to buying a portable lock. Made a new bill on parking for $20-25 a month. Oh, my car got busted into (5th floor) and the office just said \"oh sorry abt that\", & I HAD to make the effort to request a spot on the first floor since its closer to the entrance. One time a guy was passed out in the gym and I never went again LOL but thats just my experience with it. Mail room would forget to hand in the amount of packages they emailed about, sometimes would miscount too. Elevators were pretty reliable, there was only one instance of a breakdown and someone being stuck. And lastly, I had a terrible and dirty roommate that would try to speak to me any kind of way and when I addressed it with management they did nothing. So don't expect any interventions with them for some kind of roommate agreement. The only good thing was its at the village and a good distance from campus. You'd probably pay slightly less than other apartments near by for your own room and bath (they raise it yearly anyways) but its not by much so consider your options wisely!!!", "Management here is very nonchalant about their roach infestation and refuse to provide proper resolution. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Tim is very laxed in his communications and that is if they answer the phone. I don't understand how people can treat students this way. I am writing this on behalf of a sibling as students tend to be easy targets with no recourse. This place has been covered by the news before for similarly shady practices. If enough people speak out, change will occur. Thanks for nothing, UVT. Update: reported to the BBB due to unwillingness to properly resolve issue .", "All was going well here until the pandemic hit. With how nice the management was I would've thought that they would at least give tenants a break during these unprecedented times. All my respect went out the window for this place because if they really cared about us tenants, we should've been given the option to break our lease during amidst a global pandemic. Glad I'm done with this place", "They gave me the wrong apartment then tried to convince me that a 4 bed 4 bath is a 4 bed 3 bath. I talked to a staff member at the office and she apparently didn't understand english at a basic level. On my lease paper, it says in bold 4bed/4bath and she kept telling me it meant a room and a bathroom. In other words, I had to deal with an incompetent staff member who lacked a brain to get nowhere. CHOOSE SOME OTHER PLACE TO RENT.", "I have lived here for the past year since I was slowly running out of options and was desperate for a place. All the other 1 star reviews were really accurate. Living here was the worst mistake I could have made.These are just a FEW examples out of many many more: our apartment started off with the previous tenant's mess when we first moved in, there was no clear space in the living room and the kitchen counter was full of trash that they left behindwe asked for multiple maintenance fixes, but they never did anything, the fridge had rust near the water dispenser and will probably stay there for the next victimsproblems with trying to communicate with management, especially tim (read the Kriz's review)they charged me after I left for \"cleaning fees\", even though my room was cleaner than they left it for me to move into, they'll probably just charge me and do nothing about it and let the next victim move in just to rob them of their money tootheres also the issue with safety, the gates have broken locks, so that you can just push the door open and anybody could get in to the complex be right outside your door (ive seen random tweakers wander inside), and someone recently got mugged in the uvt parking lot even though theres a security guard watching the parking lotthe only good thing about this place is the shuttle that takes you to ucr, and even then whoever designed the bus schedule had some screws loose. the bus leaves uvt every x:05 and x:35 and gets to winston chung at x:10 and x:40, so you would always have to go early or always be 5-10 mins late to your class. then to go from ucr to uvt, the bus goes around campus from winston chung to the flagpole with stops in between and finally leaves campus at x:26 and x:56 so that when you finish class, you have to wait a whole 30 minutes for the bus to take you back or walk which takes less than half that time.PLEASE FOR YOUR OWN GOOD DO NOT LIVE HERE.", "The staff does a great job when it comes to enforcing the face mask policy which I appreciate. They have been following all Covid-19 regulations. This is a great first apartment for students because it comes completely furnished and has all the necessarily appliances such as a microwave and a fridge. I especially like that utilities are included with no cap and that we are provided with free wifi. The maintenance team is very courteous when entering your apartment and will complete any work order asap. However, this apartment, just like any other apartment will have tenants who aren't satisfied with anything so don't believe every negative review you are reading. Overall, this apartment is great, I moved in in 2019 and will definitely be renewing my lease.", "About 3-4 years ago they came in University of California Riverside collecting email addresses for a raffle. They've sent me constant marketing emails since. And even after I have specifically requested to \"Unsubscribe\" and have long gone graduated from UCR, they continue to violate email spam laws established in North America.", "Don't live here!!! would give 0 star. I lived here for a month and I had enough, disappointed. 1. the staff are rude and arrogant, squaring accounts in every detail. They superficially smile to you but they actually try their best to drain your money. 2. smoking-free apt? NO! My roommate is smoking cannabis however the staff seems don't care about it and did nothing after you tell them. 3. Very loud noise coming from the freeway even if you close the window. 4. Tiny bedroom and bathroom, gloomy corridor. Enjoy your life in prison if you want. 5. Absolutely overpriced! Don't trust the monthly rate on their website, you actually pay more because it is a 11.5 month contract.", "This place doesn't enforce anything. They make you pay for parking but don't enforce it when someone parks in your spot. Also, there's a big group of homeless people that basically live right outside the building. Makes me feel really uncomfortable to walk outside the building sometimes. Also, they keep increasing rent so beware of that.", "they do not care about their tenants. they do not. they will trick you into signing a lease with a false incentive and then not offer any way to terminate the lease even within a global pandemic!", "So most of these complaints are coming from students fresh from their parent's homes and expecting the top notch luxury they are accustomed to. These are student apartments people. You're expected to get a bedroom, bathroom, living room and kitchen. People complaining that their roommate leaves trash everywhere and doesn't do dishes is beyond ridiculous. Tim (manager) has been very professional and kind to me every time I called, stopped by or emailed for something. Complaints that they don't take cash? If you're mad at a leasing office for not taking cash, you should still be living at home. You can always pay with a money order for no additional fee. Maintenance has always been responsive and helped with issues we were having or provided a time frame that they would be there to fix it. The occasional washing machine or dryer won't work but if you tell the leasing office, they'll let you switch your stuff to another machine and they'll pay for your load to get done!", "Lived here for 2 years, and it was okay. I don't have any other apartments to compare it to.  Pros; the shuttle will be the best thing especially on a hot day Unlimited utilities,  so AC during the summer is a blessing Close to campus and lots of options downstairs for food Maintainance is fast on weekdays  Abundance of parking.  Don't bother asking for a guest permit it's annoying,  just have them Park on a spot without a designated number Security is around at nightCheaper if you share a bathroom with a roommate.  Comes furnished Cons Remember these apartments are occupied by college students.  Most don't clean nor maintain their own home. Especially bathrooms and kitchens.  Don't expect a spanking new apartment like in photos or even the tour.  Noise is constant  even from the 6th floor I can hear the gate always being slammed shut and open.  Someone is always running their car obnoxiously in the parking structure.  Eventually got used to it but it's still annoying.  AC in the gym is a hit or miss Staff can sometimes be rude and inconsistent Had a package come in from Amazon,  couldn't recieve it because it wasn't in there system yet, but the box was on the table.  Was told to wait til I got the email notification...  Didn't happen until 5 hours later after it got delivered.  Something is always being \"fixed or checked\" ,  therefore water is shut off and apartments will be entered.  At times I've witnessed random people enter the gym to use facilities.  Not the safest but still bothersome.", "I'd give it a 0 if I could. The staff here will let you live in abusive conditions - they let me and all 3 of my roommates basically live off antibiotics because they would not take care of a resident who had been storing biohazardous, rancid substances in the refrigerator. They kept assuring us that the issue would be resolved which is partially why we stayed for an entire year. Spoiler! The issue was NEVER resolved and eventually ALL of us had to buy our own minifridges because we no longer felt safe cooking/eating in our apartment. The manager is very rude and also tried to scam me, pricing my rent $30 higher than my roommates until I pointed it out. Had my roommates and I not have had a casual conversation about when rent was due, I'd have lost $30/month living in those awful conditions. If you try to cancel your lease, they try to force you to sublease the room to someone else. So unless you're really good at convincing people to basically take over your rent, find somewhere else. They have had 0 mercy on residents during the Covid19 pandemic. Not surprising considering I was told by a reliable friend that they will try to scam residents when they move out by claiming the room was left uncleaned. Take pictures and make sure you have evidence of everything! This place is run by monsters, not humans.", "This apartment complex barely deserves a 1 star rating. The staff at the facility are unfriendly, incompetent, and seem bothered every time you go into the office. The office is poorly organized and there are always papers and binders everywhere which they often times have to go digging for, say if I want to get a guest parking pass or get a key to either the game room or study rooms. If you were considering using the amenities they sold you on when you signed the lease, don't set your standards too high. They have the most inefficient process of lending out the keys when it comes to reserving a study room. I couldn't have thought of a worse method other than maybe a having a lottery that includes all the tenants. They let individuals borrow the key for 24 hours at a time, however you can keep the key as long as you want because there are no repercussions for returning it late. As the staff stated, \"[we] can't punish you for turning it in late\". Most of the time the study rooms are empty anyways but you can't use it without the key. The maintenance staff is a hit or miss. When we moved in, the cabinet under the kitchen sink looked moldy and when they came to 'fix it', they told us to scrub it off ourselves. They have also repeatedly ignored maintenance requests and simply stated that the request was filled without even coming to look at the problem. They have this $200 gift card for referring a friend, but good luck getting that. They never seem to have any in stock when you ask for it. Also, after my time living here, I would never subject a friend of mine to living in this complex. There's a roommate selection form you can fill out if you want to live in a less expensive apartment unit, but don't have a roommate in mind. I thought it was a great idea to find someone I'm compatible with, except the execution of the roommate matching is poor. The people I'm living with now are the opposite of what I put on the form, and are inconsiderate of the shared environment we have. This was brought up to the leasing office and they said to \"talk it out\". The problem persisted but the office could care less. They made halfhearted attempts at scheduling a roommate meeting but could care less about the follow up. Even when they were informed that there is an extra individual living in the apartment without paying rent they didn't care and did nothing about it. On the plus side if you think the rent is too expensive, you can double up with a friend and split the cost of a single room, obviously they won't evict you from the apartment even if they know what you're doing. The paint on the building may look new, but the place is falling apart. During the first week of move in the fire alarm went off every other day. The permits in all of the elevators are either missing or expired, which explains why they're non-function at times with caution tape over the entrance. The front gate to the building also never seems to be working and is sometimes propped open. I'm not too keen about this idea especially with all of the crime reported around the area by the UCPD. The list goes on and on about the agony they put you through in trying to enjoy the amenities of the apartment. The idealized manner that they portray themselves in is a fa\u00e7ade. If you're looking for a nice, quiet, and clean place to live, there are plenty of other places to sign a lease. I'm sure the smaller staff to resident ratio at other locations will lend to a friendlier living environment.", "Horrible customer service. My husband and I were eager to find an apartment for my 17 year old daughter who will be attending UC Riverside in the Fall. We drove from far, had an appointment since a month ago, and had friends who were meeting us there. Unfortunately my daughter forgot her I.D., so they did not let her do the tour, completely defeating the purpose of seeing the housing facility. When my husband asked the manager to explain the logic behind each person providing an I.D. the manager did not have an answer. I understand the importance of safety and security, but not to the extreme of requiring an underage minor to provide I.D. when her parents are there.", "Saying this place sucks is an understatement. Would give negative stars if possible. They charge you for stupid shit and rent is increasing. Also they don't accept cash for rent, forcing you to pay online which charges you a convenience fee so you pay more than the rent you agreed to pay. Did not mention this at all.The apartments are dirty and the bathrooms are cramped. Would never recommend this place ever. Stay clear. The maintenance people even come in your room without permission. Find a better apartment. Grand Marc right across is probably better. Again avoid at all costs. Don't make the same mistake I did.Update for the past couple of days they have been doing fire alarm testing and it has been so disruptive and annoying. Literally every 5-10 minutes the fire alarm goes off. Never again will I live here once my lease is over I'm gone.", "I'm rewriting this review because I've a decent space of time to consider all things. If you want the sparknotes version: Live here if you want a big, spacious room and don't care if your concerns are ignored. Pros:-The apartment itself is spacious.-My assigned roommate was a good person and we still keep in touch.-furniture, utilities, cable and internet are included with rent.-My R.A. gave me his personal phone number and is SUPER accommodating with any issues I have.-The manager is helpful most of the time. (If you can catch her, she never seems to be working when I go in.) Most office people are helpful.Cons:-Not a lot of overhead lighting. You'll get lighting in the kitchen and dining area, and (in my case) up the stairs, but not in the living room or bedroom. Makes for a dismal environment if you don't bring a lot of stand up lamps. -The bathroom a/c leaked and made the room damp and musty. I had to move to the other room in the apartment. (But the management let me so +1!) -There's one guy here that is a consistent jerk; I don't know his name but when I see he's the one working, I'll reschedule my day so I don't have to deal with him at all.\"Oh God, Why\" Circumstances:-Having the parking spot you've paid for randomly reassigned is a bad situation. Having your parking spot that you've paid for \"randomly reassigned\" three years in a row is a pattern, and if that happens you should be held accountable. -My roommate and I were gone over spring break and when we came back, her room was trashed. The ceiling had leaked while we were gone, and maintenance had just cut the rotted part out of the ceiling but hadn't patched it yet. Pieces of ceiling were all over her floor and all of her things were thrown to the side of the room. If you're in someone's home, be respectful of their things, it's common courtesy.-Due to health reasons, I sought a way out of my lease, early. (I was sick and wanted to be with my family.) Bascically I was told that if I was going to end my lease, I would be responsible for the entire year's rent, whether I lived there or not. If I was going to move out, they wanted the money up front, but if I was gonna stay, I could pay it month to month, as usual. Guess which option I chose?-I moved out of one room to the other (as I mentioned above) because my allergies were making me constantly sick. I told the office about my dust allergies and they told me I could take the next couple of weeks to move all my stuff to the other room. Except, a week later, they had changed the lock to the old room. So, I didn't clean it because, hey, locked door. When they had a cleaning crew come in, they didn't wait for me to answer the door before they entered, (they only knocked the first day, btw, the rest of the week they let themselves in with no warning.) Once inside, they started actually yelling about how dirty the room was. I had a duffel bag outside the door to the bedroom I heard it hit the wall. Meaning, my duffel bag with my electronics inside was thrown full-force against a wall. Great manners, right?-It gets better. Remember that dust allergy I mentioned? I came home a few days later to find the vent that covers the A/C unit was replaced. Cool, right? Well, it would have been excellent if the old vent that was COVERED in dust wasn't left for me to throw away.  (If yelp allows me to upload pictures, I will. For now, here's a link: http://instagram.com/p/dNUOHeTWEW/ )", "I haven't even began to live here and I already dislike it. I called today to discuss where I stood with my housing because my roommates who I was suppose to live with in the fall already got emails about their housing and key information and I hadn't. The girl that answered informed me that because I put MYSELF as the guarantor (which I DID NOT. I put my father and I have the emails to prove it.) my application was \"incomplete\" and i didn't have a room. They failed to inform me that I no longer had a room and she just kept saying \"we tried calling you\" when I'm positive they only tried two days then gave up. Emails exist? Y'all couldn't email me about this stuff?!?!? You couldn't email me about how to change my guarantor or that I had \"x\" amount of days to get back to them before they gave my room to someone else??? I LITERALLY HAD NO IDEA I DIDNT HAVE A ROOM UNTIL I CALLED. EMAILS EXIST. I will be going in person in the next few days to talk to the manager. If I still do not a have the room TO WHICH I ALREADY PAID FOR AND SIGNED THE LEASE, I want my money back. I'm frustrated that no warning emails OR calls were sent to inform me that I would not have a room and am annoyed that the girl who answered sounded like she was annoyed at my questions. If you don't want to answer calls/questions, quit.", "Overall experience wasn't bad. Everything furnished, however my closet has deep holes in them, the kitchen was getting wrecked, gum on the wall. etc. I was pissed off the most about my bathroom. The toilet didnt flush since the moment I moved in. turned in a lot of work orders and they came to fix it and then it breaks again. I have no idea why my toilet out of all of my roommates doesn't work. it's annoying to have to constantly tell them each week it doesn't work.", "I'd give it no stars if it were possible. I truly hated living here overall. I'll break it down into pros and cons. PROS:Cheaper than Grand Marc, Sterling, etc.Close to UCR.Close to UV, so if you want to eat out, a bunch of options are here.Free utilitiesFree shuttle to campus, with exception of lunch and dinner breaks for driver at 1 PM and 5 PMFree wifi, if you use an ethernet cable, the wifi runs smoothly, unless you'd rather bring your own routerFurnished: living room has a TV stand, fridge, microwave, coffee table, a taller table, chairs, couch, and the bedrooms come with a desk and mattress, so of course the bed sheets are on you.Free cable if you bring a TV.Free food every now and then, and they let you know in advance.CONS:They act all nice, I remember when I came in around my freshman year at UCR (last year) to sign a lease, the staff gave me a cup of water and acted all nice, but ONCE THEY GET YOUR SIGNATURE ON THE LEASE/CONTRACT, THEY DON'T CARE!!!!!Lighting in the room is nonexistent. You have to bring your own lamp, plus extension cords or those multiple outlet things since most lamp cords are short.Feels more like a dorm.Car is more likely to be broken into.The boss at the leasing office, I think his name is Robert, is pretty douchey, and is one of the most condescending people I've ever met. He's pretty arrogant and thinks he's the best thing since sliced bread. I've watched him multiple times smile in a sarcastic way and laugh at residents who were requesting help.Staff can be tricky, especially when you put work orders in, and they never listen to any requests for the most part.Oh yeah, that \"movie lounge\" they got going on? It's basically the employee lounge. Walk in anytime during the day, and you'll see a bunch of workers just all chilling there, so it's never possible to actually watch a movie. A girl was just kidnapped in the parking garage, and they say they've upped the security since, but no sign of security guards/police/cameras.I lived on the side facing Iowa Ave., so it was always a pain to hear cars drive past your room at all times of the day. It was particularly annoying because I lived on the first floor, and on weekends, it was just a pain to hear all the drunk people singing and shouting about how they all \"turned up.\" Walls are very thin, and my room was right next to the stairs, so on weekends I'd wake up to hungover people walking very loudly on their way out from spending the night.Fire alarms are pretty sensitive.The first week of school, back in September, someone on the upper floors threw an after party from Block Party, threw their bottles over the porch and into our porch area, and despite calling the police and notifying management, nothing was done. Management when we told them basically shrugged their shoulders and said, \"I don't care.\" \"Free laundry\" isn't anything here. They limit you to three washes and dries a month, and \"free laundry\" is done on Wednesdays only, and the machines have a consistent tendency to break down. The sinks in the bedroom bathrooms have a tendency to clog. Thankfully, 7/11 right next to UV Towers sells fluid for the occasion, though it is pretty expensive.Oh yeah, if you want to sublease your place, say because it's summer, and you want to go home, they charge you a $200 transfer to do that.Douchey security guards kick you out of the pool after 10 PM, the only exception was because when the blood moon came out in April, he was cool, but other than that, they tell you to beat it.Since most of the residents are from SoCal, they tend to sign up for the 10 month lease and leave. That's all fine, but the problem is when you're on a 12 month lease like I was, they spend the summer months cleaning up the apartments to get it ready for the next batch of residents. They don't give you any advance warning on when they'll be cleaning your room. They just stick a flyer on your door that says, \"During this week (MM/DD)-(MM/DD), we'll be doing cleaning. No warning, so just one day I was cooking lunch when I hear my door open and they just come with their stuff and just do their thing. They take advantage of the fact that most of the residents here are students living in their first apartment. I remember just one day my bedroom's toilet broke somehow and that I put in a work order. The maintenance guy comes in and tries to make it sound like he's being a nice guy when he says, \"I'll waive the labor costs and only charge you for the toilet, plus shipping/handing, and the tax,\" before saying I should expect to get the bill in my mailbox soon. I called my mom to help me out and give me some advice, and she ended up calling the office and told them off that most apartment management just covers that cost.OVERALL: DON'T LIVE HERE! I REGRET LIVING HERE, AND IT WAS A TERRIBLE PLACE TO SPEND MY FIRST YEAR LIVING OFF-CAMPUS!!! YOU'RE BETTER OFF LIVING ANYWHERE BUT HERE!!!!! DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!", "Not safe. I am currently living in a first floor apartment on the street with 4 other girls and have legitimately been scared for my safety in my own room. On many, many occasions I have heard people screaming, shouting, and scratching against my window at night. There is no security here. Regardless of what they say, management could not care less than they do now. I didn't see \"security\" until my 5th month of living here, and all he does is watch people park. Gates were busted for nearly 2 months, allowing anyone into the complex. I have made 3 different work orders regarding the leaking fridge and fire alarms that management was \"checking\" and failed to ever quiet. They chirped until I pulled them out of the walls and went to management. The woman in the front said I'd be put down as priority the next day for the handymen, but 3 weeks later they're still not fixed. This place is disgusting. I am easily paying $300 more a month than I should. Super excited for them to try to charge me for broken appliances they refused to acknowledge in the first place. Literally any other complex in Riverside is safer than this one. If you go to UCR, just live in student housing.", "This was my first time living away from home at a bright eyed 17, and I can honestly say that choosing University Towers was the worst decision I made. They had a roommate \"match\" type survey so you can move in with people you'll get along with. I was a first year arts student put into an apartment with 4 third year computer science majors who had been living together for 2 years already. So the test is bullshit.They don't manage their parking garage so some stranger was always using your assigned parking spot and you have to scramble for another spot. If I remember correctly, this is the parking garage where someone was kidnapped a few years ago. I love feeling safe.Some of the gates that use a key code didn't even lock anymore. The elevator permit was expired, and on multiple occasions the elevator stalled between floors. Don't move here.", "DO NOT SIGN THAT LEASE! These apartments are NOT safe.1. My wheels/tires have been stolen TWICE so far. The parking complex is not owned by the apartments so they have no responsibility over any theft.2. They are starting construction on a hotel right next door so it will be very loud in 2019. 3. The office doesn't care about you. - The front desk is run by young people with little to no experience and the people who manage are RUDE and dismissive. All they do is give you your packages and collect your rent. 4. The quality is very poor. - The bedrooms are fine. One problem is that they do not have lights so you have to buy your own.- the kitchens are falling apart. The fake wood panels are held by tape. The microwaves barely work, the dishwashers don't work, the stoves are fragile and begin to smoke when you try to make anything that isn't eggs. I warn you never try to bake anything in the oven.- During winter break they turn off the power, so all of the food in the fridge rotted and we had to clean everything out with bleach. The smell stayed for days. - Heaters tend to not work in winter.- The garbage chute room smells god awful. They don't clean it. - The washing machines do not clean clothes properly and the dryers leave clothes wet. - a lot of homeless people tend to lay around in the UV area and will bug you for money (trust me its not for food or a bus ticket)- the new shuttle they have to take you to school is fairly small so half of the people inside have to stand. PLEASE FIND ANOTHER PLACE! If you want to pay the bare minimum and expect low quality service then the UV Towers are the place for you.", "I am not having my son renew his lease agreement, he is living in a room and another roommate has moved in 3 other people, we have complained and nothing is being done, and yes I am very angry. Don't lease from them!!!!", "Don't live here. The apartments are nasty. At one point there was a giant water sac growing above my toilet. The water is disgusting and white. During the winter the rain filled our apartment and soaked our carpet. The air is awful, I went through a phase  here I couldn't stop coughing but only when I was in my apartment and I'm pretty sure they have mold growing in the walls. I had a scary encounter with a guy who watched me walk all the way to my apartment and then tried knocking on my door he left and put on a security guard shirt and came back so I would trust him. Luckily my roommates were there and whatever he was planning he realized he was outnumbered and asked for a pen. Sketchy if you ask me. People have their cars stolen, shootings in the village, kidnappings in the parking garage. I never felt safe there past 8 pm.", "I'd give them no stars if possible, this place had some plus sides, but after the sh*tstorm they put us through, methinks not.Pros-Utilities and furniture are included. They also have a decent sized pool and two grills for the summer time.- The shared living area is pretty large, and individual rooms have locks and bathrooms, which is definitely a nice perk. -Depending on your room number, some suites have a balcony as well and its got one of the best views in Riverside.ConsHooh mama, here we go.Strike 1: After we came back from winter break, a leak had formed and there was water damage. We mentioned it to the office, but nothing was done. That water damage turned into mold, still with no help from the office. After repeated complaints all the way up to the manager, we finally got moved to a new room after it got so bad the apartment started to smell. A few months roll by, and they demand that we move back into our old apartment and that everything has been \"taken care of\". Wary of a potential lung infection, I went back to my old apartment in advance and found nothing had been done, and that the 3 foot line of water damage coming down from my ceiling was definitely still there.Strike 2: I get a call one night from a friend who works in the office saying my motorcycle has been tipped over. Now I FREAKING LOVE my motorcycle, and was pissed but understanding of the situation. I'm told to  come back the next morning and fill out a form. I get to the office the next day and the people seem completely unsympathetic and unhelpful to what has happened. One guy even went so far as to say, \"Oh, it was just tipped over.\" Wrong. Next time, when someone tips over your Chevy Silverado you can tell me how it was \"just tipped over\". My roommate got the same response when someone broke into his car on the sixth floor. How bout dat security?But the Strike 3 icing on the cake: Our neighbors usually throw sketchy 100+ people parties, which are loud as hell, but hey I'm not one to be a buzzkill. That all changed one night when I hear \"BLAM BLAM Get the fuck out of my apartment!\" Seriously? I know it's Riverside and all, but I'm not paying $740/mo to have shootings go down next door. You'd think living next door to the RA would guarantee some safety, but I guess not. Going along with the trend, the office did absolutely nothing to reassure us that things had been taken care of, and it was only after I inquired that I found out that the tenants had been moved to a different floor, but not evicted. O.oGood location, but for what it costs, you can find crack houses with more security.", "I think this place honestly isn't that bad. There are probably more cons than pros to this place. So let's start at the beginning of the year and work our way to the end.Move-in: They say you get free parking spaces. YAY... the catch? You have to be one of the first like 30 people to move in or you either pay $30 a month for the first floor or $20 for the 4th and 5th floor. Two elevators only for everybody for all 8 floors. Luckily I only had to make 3 trips so not that bad, but everybody else I could see had mounds of stuff and could tell it took them a while. My overall move-in experience was alright.Living there for the rest of the year: Honestly, was not that bad. We tried to keep our common area as clean as we could but some things were already messed up or dirty when we moved in. Such as the ceiling and the couches. Rooms were actually surprisingly clean. The people who lived above us we heard almost every night doing some sort of construction or moving around. EVERY night. We knew we couldn't file a complaint as there would be no point. So other than the noise above us, it was pretty quiet. The freeway though, you could hear pretty dang well, rush hour, gg. Leave your window open and you won't be able to fall asleep. The nice thing though was walking to campus took 10 minutes from there to the Arts building (to Psych it took about 20-25 depending on lights). The parking garage, my car never got broken into, buy my roommate's did. Stole the battery and spare tire. They broke into all the Hondas that day. Luckily, mine was a Dodge so mine was never touched. But yeah, UVT does not take responsibility for it. They claim it to be safe because of a guard but he does not do anything but walk around. They are strict on towing though, if you park over night, they will tow you. When leaving for class I think I saw I car a day getting towed. I heard it's a lot quieter than GrandMarc though, like the walls are thicker at UVT. Also laundry does suck because it costs 2.50 total to wash and dry. More than dorms! This comes out of your own pocket too, free laundry day sucked because I had class all day on W. Post-leaving: Just got charged $40 for cleaning in the common area. Just me though! I called my roommates, none of them got charged but me. The manager even said \"all of you are responsible for it\" so why am I the ONLY one paying? Yeah, it's not a lot thankfully, but when you say all, you mean all 4, not just me. Staff is/was(?) super friendly and saw them around outside of school. I'm not sure of the staff now but I actually liked them and felt they were there to help you in any way they could. What blows is last year when we signed the lease we got no prizes but this past year they gave away iPads, Kindles, gift cards, you name it, and I'm like... where was that last year when we signed up in FEBRUARY?! So I got kind of ticked for that and we received nothing. Other than that the main reason this is 2 ratings is because your car can be broken into, freeway noise, false advertising on their part and the only reason it's not one is because of their friendly staff when I lived there. OH and it's super close to eating and stuff so that always was a bonus, just walk to eat wherever.", "First, I came in with a optimistic and positive attitude and toured this place 3 times with friends, family and roommates BUT This place is absolutely deceiving, ridiculous and overpriced. Don't even think about moving here. The model apartment might be nice and clean but the actual apartments are dirty, smelly and disgusting. When I first moved in, the floors were sticky, the bathroom toilet was broken and disgusting. I had a non flushing toilet the moment I moved in. They came in to fix it the next day and I guess they did, because it flushes but it wont stop flushing, so now I have a toilet that wont stop running most of the time and works like a normal toilet sometimes. Next, the late fees are ridiculous on top of their overly expensive apartment rates ($75 late fee). Trust me, you can find ridiculously nice apartments for $500-600 / month, if you are willing to sacrifice a tanning room no one uses, a computer lab with printers that are suppose to be free if you bring paper but there is never any ink and the useless movie theater where it always smells like weed. Finally, the rude service. The initial tour  to get you to sign your contract has exemplary service but once you pass the signature and you're locked in for a year, they do not care about you. The front desk students aren't rude but aren't nice either. They'll do what you ask but in the most careless way possible that it makes you think that they're ALWAYS having a bad day. Other notable things:Parking garage sucks ass because its shared with UV and residents have to park on the fourth floor and above.The pools close at 10pm and we were kicked out by a douchebag security guard. Their fire alarms ALWAYS go off. I remember one day, the fire alarm went off every hour from 9 pm till 2 AM. It pissed everyone off. The fire marshalls came and made a huge scene, it ended up being nothing even important. Overall. DONT LIVE HERE and DONT LET THEM RIP YOU OFF. THEY RIPPED ME OFF AND TOO MANY OTHERS OFF.", "The apartment itself is ok. It's the staff & management that stinks. The first night I moved in there was a drunk bum that walked off the streets and into our complex. Note: there are gates to this complex, but they are never shut. The bum banged on our door and said he was going to kill everyone inside. Safe, huh? After calling the police to have him removed, I wanted to speak to management and be moved to a different room. They would not allow it, nor would they do anything to prevent it from happening in the future.Later that year I the A/C unit started leaking in my bathroom. I had to put a garbage can under it to stop the water that was leaking into my bedroom carpet. I called maintenance and they came in, inspected it, then just left. I was left with a watery bathroom for days before it was fixed. It leaked again later in the year and the same thing happened where it took days to get fixed. The second time they came in to fix it, they also left orange paste ALL OVER my bathroom that I had to clean up. Later I found that my white face towel had dirty fingerprints all over it. Ridiculous! When you fix something you do not dirty something else. I had to go to the office and complain and even then it's a fight to get anything done around there.At the end of the year they check your room before you leave to see if there was any damage. They walked through my apartment and said everything looked fine. Weeks later my roommate and I were billed a cleaning fee. I had to call them multiple times before they would waive the fee. After the horrible service they provided throughout the year, there was no way I was paying that cleaning fee especially since any damage would have been due to their lack of promptness when a problem was reported.Don't live here. It looks nice when you tour it, but that's just for looks.", "The blond girl at the front office is so so rude. She hung up on my phone call because she seemed agitated by me. Very unprofessional! All my friends and I do NOT expect to renew my lease SOLELY because of this rude employee. I don't know why UV administration hasn't fired her yet. Every single encounter I have with her is met with rudeness and sarcasm from her. I don't think she understands that not many people like her at all. I have about 7 friends who live here and all of them have some REALLY negative views on her......even my friends' FRIENDS do not like her. I guess that comes as a result of being such a rude jerk to everyone.", "To start off moving in/out of this place is a pain because you have to park on the 4th floor at the best and you have to move everything up and down the elevator for both the parking garage and getting to your apartment floor. The only pros I can think of is that the maintenance staff will be there either the same day or the next day of when you put in your work order. Also the rooms they give you Are pretty clean.The con is the office staff. They are NOT helpful at all and the most they can do for you is activate your key or give you overnight parking permit passes. We tried talking to the financial guy about our problems and he basically kept smiling and laughing at us. He was downright RUDE. DON'T LIVE HERE YOU WILL REGRET IT!", "The leasing office has NO interest helping you out changing the move in date. Everyone must move in on September 15th, they don't care if you have an orientation on the 13th. Great excuse saying that is to be fair for everyone! Also, poor online system for new tenant. Super confusing when it shows $0 balance, but you are supposed to pay the full month rent. Terrible pre-move-in experience.", "Horrible living conditions and tried to poison me with bug spray without a notice. There is ton of homeless people that attack the renter. This is place is so disorganized the office staff is rude and never follow through with work orders and crystal is the most disrespectful employee there. I got my car broken within in a month of living here and the staff didn't care stating they are not responsible. The apartments next to the freeway and the noise is so loud and all night the headlight shine into your room. The first day I moved in my room was disgusting and that nobody cleans the apartments before you move in you have to wait three days to have them come and clean it. There's so many things wrong with the apartment it's not worth it.", "This residence does not even deserve a star.I moved into what looks more like a garbage dump than an apartment. Since I've moved in (barely 2 weeks), I already complained several times and nothing (or almost nothing) changed - Some furnitures are broken or a part of them is missing it. -Two of my roommates and myself do not stop complaining to the managers about the fourth one without success. The apartment is disgusting, she's leaving garbage bags in the communal areas, she's smoking inside.... But they keep telling me that she is a \"nice girl\" instead of doing something about those problems- It is not possible to buy a laundry card because the machine is broke and they have no ideas when someone will repair it...And the list goes on and on So all this to say that I really regret having moved into this residence and I will recommend you to go anywhere else but here", "Just plain ass bad... Shit was everywhere in the apartment when I moved in and the CAs are never really heat when needed.", "It was pretty bad. The staff just usually waits around for things to get done on their own time. I'm glad I only had to stay there one year but hopefully they fix things up better and care more about their residents.", "Looks are deceiving! I moved into these apartments because I was starting college and need a place to stay. This was the only place that accepted a deposit since I could not get a cosigner which was a good thing. The model room they show you is amazing, seems like you'd live pretty comfortable there, WRONG! Living there was a disaster! My room was literally a square. My roommates were so dirty, I did not even like being in my apartment! And to transfer rooms they'd charge me a fee. One of my roommates had people over and sleep over for WEEKS at a time and no one in the front ever told her anything! My apartment smelled like marijuana 24/7 due to my roommate smoking it day in and day out. Yes, the cabinets are actually moldy as seen in some users pictures. The rent here must be paid online or by check, cannot be paid in cash. Once I was able to leave, I left, not looking back. Horrible experience at these apartments. I was paying $660+ to live an apartment where I could not even cook because my roommates would never wash their dishes, there is ONE security guard that does not even guard. Cars park where they want when they want, but you only get a \"3rd Notice for Towing\" if you are parking in one of the employees parking spots (WHICH ARE NOT MARKED) when you haven't even gotten a first or second notice. Only good thing about these apartments is that they are close to food places and the movie theater. I would not recommend this place to anyone that wants safety and cleanliness, listen to these reviews, they are not lying!", "I would give no star if I could! This place is consider over priced in riverside area , not worth the money! The room is way too small, and the staffs are just a bunch of assholes.(ladies are friendly, I mean males besides the repair guys)Especially the fat ass \"supervisor\" who always wears black shirt and black glass, sitting in his small little dumbass glass case, thinks he is da boss ,mean and has poor attitude, they care shit!!! They just want your money, here and there! If you forget to bring your key , you have to pay for \"borrowing fee\", if you moving out , they will charge you cleaning fee at least $30 no matter what , if you park your car overnight, they threaten you to towed your car, freaking ripoff shit hole. Our microwave was broken, told the fat ass \" supervisor\" to send some one to fix ASAP , never hear from  him ever since.  I guess everyone could be da \" supervisor\" as long as u r fat, dumb, and careless! Good luck assholes!", "So far it's been really good living here. The staff is really nice and I adore my roommates. I haven't had any issues with people too loud yet, so that's a plus.", "I have a nice view, but there is a lot of noise from the freeway when i open my window. It's a good walk from campus but you get to see the riverside life a bit more because of that.", "This place is the absolute worst. I moved in here to save money from the over-priced student dorms on campus, but this place is literally hell. All terrible the reviews are true! I have lived here for a month and a half and I'm moving out already due to the poor conditions of the apartment, shitty roommates, constantly feeling unsafe, and shitty management. When I was desperate for a room, I toured this place and made sure it was really worth my money. On the tour, they had a specific route they took so you wouldn't see all the shitty parts of the apartments. They only showed you the amenities and model room, which were really nice. I decided to move in, and as soon as I started for my room, I knew that I had made a terrible fucking mistake. The elevators were in poor conditions, the hallways were long, and seemed very unsafe especially during the night time. I got to my room, and there was still underwear and trash from the previous tenant under my closet, the toilet was broken, there was no light, and my sink fell apart the next morning. I wanted to discuss my problems with my roommates and my room with the management, but they were not very welcoming or helpful. Tim, specifically, has a terrible attitude problem. He is completely unfit to be a manager. The least he could do is act like he cares, but when you are speaking to him, he acts very bothered and annoyed that you even came in with your problems. I asked if I could speak to him in his office, and his responses were very insincere and rude. He was very dismissive of my problems, and did not seem like he cared at all. I am paying 820 dollars a month, and I am so upset because this place was just not worth my money. It's overpriced for shitty quality. If you're going to spend your money on pricey apartments, make sure you don't come to this place. I would give it no stars if I could. I have been looking for someone to take my lease, so I can move out since the day I moved in. I still not have found anyone, but I can't blame them. This place is so terrible I'm willing to pay 3 months rent to leave this month. I have been trying to find corporate's number, so I can report Tim, but I have not been able to find it. Do NOT sign a lease with this place, it's not worth it.", "It hurts to give a star to this place at all. If you bring a car, there's a ridiculously high chance that it will get broken into. Mine got broken into THREE times in ONE week January 2010. And of course, the apartment will take no responsibilities and will not put in cameras or gates. They tell you that you get free laundry service. What they don't tell you is that it's only on Wednesdays from 8AM to 6PM and you get 3 washes and 3 dries a month. They also tell you that you have 24 hour computer lab access. No. They tried that and two of the three computers were stolen. Okay, fine. But then stop advertising '24 hour computer lab access.' And the coffee bar? It's literally a bar with a coffee maker on it. You could make better coffee in your room. The entertainment lounge that they supposedly have open for everyone has basically become an employee lounge. Seriously. Go look for yourself sometime and see if there's anyone in there and if there is, they're wearing a UVT employee shirt, right? Yea. Oh and the shower drains ALWAYS clog. Have them come fix it, clogs in two days. Fix, clog. Fix, clog. The staff is terrible - for those who said they didn't know why people say they're bad, they clearly haven't had to talk to them beyond picking up mail packages. They lie all the time and make excuses for everything. They will say anything to get on what they think is your good side but be really sneaky and go behind your back to do things like go in your room without your permission - thinking that you won't find out. You know that they plan things against you when you do something they don't like because they have little meetings to discuss the \"issue\" in their leasing office and when they see you coming, stand up to try to get a better view and make sure it is you, and then stop talking. They have also been racist between my housemates when I lived there [2009-2010]. All in all, signing the lease is pretty much signing your life away because it's so specific and binding that there is no way you can get out of it no matter how bad the circumstances/conditions get. AND after I left, they tried to charge me more money for stuff at the apartment that they never said anything about when I was leaving. Just don't live here.", "I think this place is cool and safe. I enjoy how it is right next to the village and all the eating establishments. I would so love living here again.", "So far so good. I love having my own room and the staff is friendly to me every time I have questions or go pick up my mail. Keep up the good work.", "Overall I think my experience has been pretty good. I have had a good response time to my work orders, packages are easy to pick up, my roomates are cool and it's really close to campus so I don't have to drive and pay for parking.", "So I've been living in UVT for about half the year now, and honestly, I have not major complaints. People have been giving it pretty low ratings, but I will try to draw out everything someone may wanna know about this apartment. I cant really compare it to Grand Marc, Sterling, or any of the other apartments complexes around the UCR campus. I will start with the pros.PROs-cheaper than Grand Marc and Sterling ($735 for a 4x4 [floor plans and rates http://www.universityvillagetowers.com/floorPlans.php)-fully furnished apt-really big kitchen (with stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, cabinet space)-washer and dryer on each floor-beds, desk, closet included in prices  -walking distance to campus-balcony option-pool and hot tub-movie room-exercise room-computer rooms-relatively spacious (in comparison to my triple pentland dorm)-parking (for some people; will explain in cons :[)-pretty nice in general-close to great eating places and stores--Flame Broiler, Teriyaki Bowl, Fat Burger, Del Taco, Denny's, Santana's, 7-11, Yoshinoya (not good), Starbucks, Quiznos, Subway, Mongolian BBQ, Ranch 1, Busy Cafe, Game Stop, yogurtland, and many more.-good staff-helpful and nice-not tied down like a dorm would cause (ie. alcohol, drugs, noise, parties, etc. [not enforced :P])Cons:-price (I know I'm contradictory, but depending on your price range it can be pricey for some)-parking (I thought the price of rent would cover free parking in the structure, but nope...first come first serve for X amount of spaces, so i have to pay $20 more a month -__-)-kinda ghetto in a way--witness some drag races coming down off the top of the parking structure, drug deals, shady people at night, etc-along the freeway so you can hear all the traffic (not bad tho...double panned windows)-one of my packages was lost-some planned activities, but none worth doing--pretty pointless-roommate never got money from leasing office (had a offer at the time--$200 each person you refer. Me and 2 of my other roommates put he referred us and he still did not get the money)-fire alarms go off quite a bit-printers in the computer room never workThats about it...I cant think anything else off the top of my head...the cons arent so bad... think UVT deserve a sold 3/5", "Paper-thin walls, cheap appliances, cheap carpet, concrete slab beds, the most uncomfortable, cheap couches you will ever sit on, slow internet.I guess its a minor improvement from a dorm room, but definitely not a nice apartment.Student apartments =/= apartments", "I thought I was going to give this place a 4 or 5 stars. Mehh. I wil give it 2.5. CONS:1.) On a whole DO NOT MOVE to this area In the first place. It is extremely dangerous! a woman was raped and broad daylight near UCR campus, and another was brutally attacked with a hammer.2.) Do NOT park on the bottom floors because it will get broken into. Another thing, it sucks that if you have guests stay over night, their car has a  HIGH chance of being towed-which truly sucks! Cars that do not get towed away are the vehicles with the UVT sticker on their dash, and in their correct spots (which gets annoying sometime because people from the plaza ALWAYS park in the assigned spots unknowingly). 3. Forget the room-mate \"matching services\". I've overheard a manager just trying to fill rooms up as \"quickly as possible\". I feel sorry for the 4 x 4 renters. 4. If you forget to pay your rent, they will send your account over to collections ASAP. Dont forget to!5. The people here are DEAD, this place is NOT popping! for the people who like to study but have some fun, this is not the place for you. ITS Study or STUDY! 6. RIVERSIDE is a dump. If you got accepted into UCR, make the best of it.7. Dorm-like. Not for ones who want a homey-apartmenty feel.8. No closetsPROS:1) The staff are pretty nice and helpful, they're not as bad as I've heard.2) This is the safest Student apartment in Riverside (Palms and Grandmarc is is another story).3.\") walking distance from the University Plaza=)4.) you get free utilities no cap.5.) free breakfast on some mornings. usually around midterms and finals.", "Pretty good since it comes furnished and all amenities are included with no caps. Most rooms are repainted, cleaned and fixed before a new tenant moves in.", "close to ucr . Very quiet place and surround by restaurant I spent two weeks the first time and I like it", "Most of the staff are rude, most are undergraduate college students so I guess it's not surprising. The apartments, inside and outside, always smell like weed. The smell goes through the ventilation system. When requesting a work order, their response is inconsistent, sometimes a day, sometimes a week. Also, the maintenance workers that come to do the repair, leave behind a mess and it's always clear that they were in my apartment. The apartment isn't thoroughly cleaned when you first move in. The parking structure also is not ideal. My car has been scratched at least twice within a month, just from sitting in its parking spot. The shuttle that is for UV Tower residents only, is always ridden by other students from other apartment complexes, only the main shuttle driver (out of 4 or 5 drivers) checks to see if you live at UV. Make sure you always get a receipt of your rent payment, because they couldn't find my payment one month and they also lost their copy of the receipt so I had to email them a picture of my receipt.", "This place could be a great place. It's in a great location but the people who run this place only care about making money. Once you're in you're not going to get out. The day we moved in there were hundreds of empty beer bottles littered all over the living room, inside the cupboards, and all over the balcony. We had to clean out the apartments ourselves and drive to a recycling center. The rim of the toilet was lined with a layer of shit that still never washes off completely to this day. Stoves are greasy and microwaves are filthy. Rotting food leftover from previous tenants hide under the stove and between the refrigerator. Random fire alarms go off once in a while for hours straight at 3am in the morning. And the walls are THIN! I can literally hear everything the people living in the apartment next to me do. Everyday they blast their bassy music. Thump thump thump from 8am to 3am! I can hear them laughing, watching tv, playing basketball, watching sports, and screaming. It's so ridiculous. I can hear them dribbling their basketball from my own living room, which is separated by two rooms from their apartment. Unless your bank account is made of gold and your checks are made of gold, do yourself a favor and rent out one of many houses in the city of Riverside with a couple of friends for half the price and none of the hassles of UVT. You are even better off staying in the dorms!", "I like that you can sign for an individual lease and not be dependent on your roommates. I also like that rent includes utilities and the apartment comes prefurnished. The staff are friendly and helpful, though a bit unorganized at times. The amenities are decent but not exceptional. My biggest problems are the incessant noise from the freeway and the fire alarms goes off constantly."]}]
